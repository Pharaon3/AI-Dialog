        "content1": "How many minutes of your life have you wasted adjusting the margins in a Google Doc just to make the page break appear at a less awkward spot? Well, you can now waste your time adjusting other trivial app settings instead. The new Google Docs pageless mode means you can create a document with no page breaks.\nHow to make Google Docs pageless\nHere's how to turn on pageless mode in Google Docs:\nGo to File > Page setup.\nSelect Pageless, and press OK.\nWhile you're there, you can also change the background color (please don't), and set it so that all your Google Docs start as pageless (click Set as default).\nHow to remove page breaks in Google Docs\nPower up your Google apps with automation\nAutomate Google apps\nIt's possible you're just here to learn how to remove a page break in Google Docs. In the past (and still), you could do that by double-clicking on the page break.\nIt pulls your pages together, so your section headers don't end up as the last line on a page, and your images don't have a ton of white space above or below them. But it also inexplicably leaves a horizontal dotted line.\nHere's my dog, Winston, in what's now known as pages mode, after having double-clicked the page break.\nAnd here's Winston in pageless Google Docs.\nIt's a subtle difference, but the lack of a dotted line makes it feel a little more polished. Plus, the images change size depending on the size of your screen, so Winston will always be just right.\nWhat else is different about the Google Docs pageless format?\nIf you're using a pageless Google Doc to write a standard document, you won't notice much difference other than the lack of page breaks. But here are the main things to keep in mind.\n1. You can customize the page width\nYour doc will be infinitely long, but you get to choose how wide it is. \nGo to View > Text width (the option is only there if you're already in pageless mode), and you can choose between Narrow, Medium, Wide, and Full. \nPlay around with it to see what you like, but Wide or Full (after clicking into both a million times, I still have no idea what the difference is) will give your doc the most blank-slate Notion-type vibe. Regardless of which width you choose, if you zoom in or out, the size will automatically adjust for you, so you won't lose content off the screen.\nKeep in mind that your text width choice only affects your view of the document. Everyone who views the doc will see it in pageless mode, but the specific width will vary depending on the viewer's settings.\n2. Tables are different in pageless view\nI had a heck of a time trying to format my table to look the way I wanted it to in pageless view. It was almost impossible for me to get a small-ish table to be left-aligned, and every time I adjusted a column width, it made some other questionable decisions for me.\nI'm sure I'd get the hang of it after playing around with it more, but it definitely takes some getting used to.\nThe good news: in pageless format, tables will scroll left-to-right instead of smushing.\n3. Some features are missing in pageless mode\nYou can't have page numbers in pageless view, which makes sense, but you also lose the ability to have columns, headers, footers, and apparently watermarks. I added most of these things to a document, and when I switched over to pageless format, they were gone. But when you switch back, they're still there\u2014so no need to panic.\nPlus, if you have any formatting that will be \"lost\" in pageless mode, it'll warn you before you make the change.\nHow to turn off pageless in Google Docs\nFeeling done with your pageless experiment? Here's how to get rid of pageless format in Google Docs.\nClick File > Page setup.\nIf you're already in pageless format, it'll default to the Pageless tab of Page Setup. Click the Pages tab toward the top.\nClick OK.\nThat's it\u2014you turn off pageless by turning on pages.\nPageless Google Docs: What's the verdict? \nI'm sticking to pages for now. But I tend to use Google Docs mostly for editing blog articles, where it doesn't matter if there's an awkward page break. If you need your Google Docs to look pretty or want the more blank-slate feel, I'd say it's time to make the switch.\nRelated reading:\nHow to use Google Docs version history\nHow to use variables in Google Docs\nHow to create and autopopulate a Google Docs template\nThis article was originally published in April 2022.

        "content1": "Writing a blog post shouldn't be a matter of filling out a template\u2014that's a recipe for disappearing into the internet content landfill. But using a template for a blog post brief is a great way to make sure your writers have all the information they need before diving in.\nHere's a link to our content brief template in Google Docs. Make a copy and give it a spin, but first, keep reading for insights on how to make the most of it.\nIf you use an app to manage your editorial calendar, you can automate the process of creating the brief. Include fields in your app for each of the template sections, and then automatically populate the template every time you mark the article as \"In progress.\"\nWhat is a content brief\u2014and when should you use one?\nHow to use OpenAI's GPT to spark content ideas\nLearn how\nA content brief is a short (brief!) document that offers a high-level overview of what a piece of content will include. When using it for blog content, it usually includes notes on everything from keywords and internal links to audience and competitor articles.\nFull disclosure: we don't really use article briefs at Zapier. But there's a reason for that: we've had more than a decade to figure out what we're doing, and we've found a groove that works without them. Having said that, there are definitely exceptions\u2014times when we recommend using briefs, even for content types you've done a million times. \nHere are a few situations where using a brief is important:\nWhen you're creating a very standardized content type. An example would be our best apps pieces\u2014they have the same structure every time, so we have a brief template for them.\nWhen you're working with inexperienced writers. Experienced marketers think about their audience and can generally put together an outline without a template. But if you're working with less experienced writers, it can help them keep their audience, keywords, and goals in mind.\nIf a partner is writing the article. If you're working with a partner, it's likely they have their own blog with their own standards, voice, and style. A brief can help you be sure they give you what you're looking for instead of defaulting to their own rules.\nWhen you're working with agencies. Agencies might be working with hundreds or even thousands of clients, which means you need to be more in-your-face about your company's needs. (Note: if you're working with an agency or freelancer, you might want to add a Tone and style section to your brief so that brand voice is fresh in their mind.)\nSEO content brief template\nHere's our content brief example to kickstart your process. Make a copy, and then personalize it for your brand.\nDownload the template\nHow to write a content brief\nThere are two ways to fill out an article brief template: you can do it, or you can have your writers do it. Which you choose depends on a lot of factors, but here, I'm assuming you'll be filling this out for your writers.\nTitle\nDrop the suggested title of the article here. The title might\u2014and probably will\u2014change after the writer has completed the draft, but this will ensure everyone's in alignment on the hook for the article: what is it that's going to make people want to read this post?\n1-sentence description\nOther than the target audience, I'd say this is the most important part of the brief. This sentence tells your writer: here is the information you must convey in this piece. Limiting it to one sentence ensures that it doesn't accidentally turn into a mini-outline. (Although some editors do like to include mini-outlines in their briefs.)\nTarget audience\n\"Know your audience\" is the golden rule of content marketing. What you put here will be very different if you're working on B2B content vs. B2C content.\nIf you're writing B2B content, here are some questions you should be asking:\nWhat's their industry?\nWhat's their role?\nWhat's their experience level with the topic?\nWhat stage in the customer journey are they at?\nWhat's their pain point? / Why are they reading this article?\nFor B2C content, you'll ask slightly different questions:\nWhat are their demographics?\nWhat do they care about?\nWhat stage in the customer journey are they at?\nWhat is their pain point? / Why are they reading this article?\nAs an example, for this article, I might write:\nEntry- to mid-level blog editors (sometimes in the form of business owners) who are looking to add some structure to their processes. These readers generally know what a content brief is and have maybe used one before but are looking for a template that might work for their current needs.\nIf you have a content funnel, this is also a good place to indicate where in the funnel your reader is.\nPrimary keyword\nEven if you're not looking for organic traffic, you want your piece to be SEO-friendly\u2014it can never hurt to get more eyes on your article. Determining a primary keyword will also help your writer better understand the core concept they should be highlighting.\nHere are some apps that will help you in this section:\nThe best free keyword research tools\nThe best SEO content optimization tools\nThe best SEO tools\nSecondary keywords\nSecondary keywords will usually come up naturally as the writer develops the piece, but including them here does two things:\nIt helps the writer think of other ways to express the primary keyword (how many times can you say \"revenue growth plan\" in one article?).\nIt helps the writer think about related topics and how they might make their way into this article.\nAgain, be sure to refer to your SEO tools for help here.\nSEO title\nThis is what shows up on the browser tab and in the search results page. It should be 65 characters max and can include the name of your company for brand awareness (although recently, Google has started truncating company names in SEO titles).\nSEO meta description\nThis is the description that appears under the SEO title in the Google Search results. Sometimes Google will ignore it and put whatever they want there, but this is your chance to draw people in with more than just your title. Google also bolds any matching keywords from the user's search, so make sure you include a keyword in there.\nThe general rule of thumb is that your SEO description should be 155 \u2013 160 characters to fill up the space without getting cut off.\nWord count\nWord count is a slippery slope, so that's why we include some boilerplate language about how the word count is just an estimate. You don't want people basing how much they write on the word count; you want them basing it on what it takes to get the message across.\nIf you're working with less experienced writers, make it clear that these are just estimates. I find that saying something like \"~1,000 words\" works better than saying \"1,000-1,200\" words. The latter ends up feeling like a specific barrier, and you might get people trying to add filler or cutting helpful content just to make it fit.\nInternal links\nIf you run a blog, you probably know every single piece of content that's been published on that blog (\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). Remember: your writers don't. If there are specific articles you want them to link to, include those here. \nThat doesn't mean that you can't add more internal links as you're editing, but this first step serves two purposes:\nIt familiarizes your writer with the similar pieces you've published, so they don't create redundant content.\nIt gives them another source of inspiration.\nCompetitor articles\nThere are a couple reasons you want to include links to competitor articles:\nIt helps the writer confirm they haven't missed any obvious considerations.\nIt helps the writer see what gaps they can fill in that aren't in the competing articles.\nIf there's anything you specifically love (or hate) about the competitor articles, you can mention that here as well.\nCTA\nHopefully your blog has a built-in call-to-action (CTA) somewhere\u2014maybe it's to subscribe to your email list or to sign up for your service. But you might also consider an in-article CTA. Do you want people to read another article when they finish this one? Do you want them to comment on the article? Follow you on social? Join your online community? Be specific.\nWe do this in a few ways at Zapier.\nSometimes we link out to other Zapier articles we think will be helpful. You can do this within the body of the article, as part of the narrative.\nOr you can add a little callout box.\nOn some pieces, we add a blurb about what Zapier is and how to sign up.\nBefore you decide on a CTA, think about where in the content journey your user is and what you want them to do next.\nNotes\nThe last section in our template is called Notes. That's deliberately vague\u2014each article is different, and you need a spot to put those idiosyncratic, article-specific comments. This is that spot.\nPersonalize your content brief\nAt Zapier, we use different formats for content briefs depending on the project. For example, many of our SEO content briefs are actually spreadsheets\u2014they're data-heavy, with lots of keyword analysis, so a spreadsheet suits us better. Our briefs for best apps lists and app comparison articles, however, are long documents, each one very specific to the topic at hand.\nOnce you have a template you love, learn how to autopopulate a Google Docs template. Here are a couple of automated workflows to get you started, but you can automate your content briefs no matter what app you use for your editorial calendar.\nCopy data from new Google Sheets rows to a Google Doc template\nTry it\nCreate Google Docs from a template for new Airtable records\nTry it\nZapier is a no-code automation tool that lets you connect your apps into automated workflows, so that every person and every business can move forward at growth speed.

We started the call, and she immediately asked about the artwork (generous term) behind me. It was a giant kid-painted mural that we'd slapped up on the wall two years earlier and never took down, I told her. She said she liked it, and that she actually had her own doodles on her wall.\nPretty impressive framed doodles.\nI'd seen those framed pieces behind her for a year, and until that conversation, I had no idea she'd drawn them.\nThis kind of interaction doesn't happen if you blur your background. And as much of a curmudgeon as I like to think I am, it's nice to have those moments.\nBy keeping your background visible, you get to know your remote coworkers better. You might see their partner or kid or dog walk by in the background. You might notice a mirror they have, ask where they got it, and then buy multiples for your own house (true story). Or you might just see that the sun's out where they are and live vicariously.\nSo unless there's something borderline illegal happening behind you\u2014in which case, please don't make me report you, Joey\u2014don't blur your background.\nMore Zoom tips\nHow to automate Zoom\nHow to share part of your screen on Zoom\nHow to add your pronouns on Zoom\nHow to play background music on Zoom\u2014without sharing your screen\nHow to automatically upload Zoom recordings to Google Drive\nHow to change your profile picture in Zoom\nThis article was originally published in Match 2022.

        "content": "Hobi, our new context engine, allows Zapier to keep customer data safe.",
        "content1": "In the security world, we're tasked with assessing many alerts daily: We have to decide which alerts need a response, then gather additional data and filter out false positives, often with little upfront context. We wanted to address this problem by building a specialized tool: an in-house, Zapier-specific context engine named Hobi. After a year and a half of work leading the design and engineering of our new context engine, it is complete. I would love to share what it's about.\nThe problem with security alerts: They often lack context.\nThe role of Security Detection and Response is to understand and follow up when something deviates from expected business operations. This helps keep our business running smoothly and our customers' data safe. We have many specific alerts designed to watch out for anything that looks like unusual activity.\nSometimes, it's easy to determine whether an event is a legitimate concern or not by how much information our SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) has been able to gather from a log source. But often, we have the manual task of looking at other data sources to gather additional context around an alert. \nWhen an alert triggers, we generally need supplementary contextual data to understand the big picture fully. This includes locations, IPs, activity and event information from other platforms, and the usual activity done by the actor or service in the alert. The investigator gathers this information from many different tools and takes up a large percentage of alert triage time.\nHobi collects data automatically to create context\nHobi, our context engine, is designed to perform most of the data gathering needed for effective alert triage. It's a modular tool with libraries for gathering data from log aggregators, identity providers, cloud environments, and more. It can check IP WHOIS information, do geolocation lookups, pull historical user IP addresses, and much more. It's a fancy way of saying that we now automatically gather information from various log sources around the company to build a better picture of what the activity in question actually means before any human has ever laid eyes on it. Hobi collects this information in real-time as alerts are generated and can also be invoked as part of the investigation process if more information is needed.\nOur context engine allows us to use this newly available data within the alert logic, helping to decide whether an activity is expected, if the alert is a false positive, or whether the severity should be modified. Hobi also has a built-in Slack module that allows us to gather information about resources or employee feedback that might be part of the alert's context. This new pre- and post-alert contextualization automates away what was previously done manually.\nHow does Hobi differ from a SOAR?\nFor context, SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It's a group of security technologies that allows organizations to respond to incidents automatically.\nHobi focuses on aggregating and consolidating information from various services and tooling to provide additional context for an alert. It is part of the entire alert pipeline from logic to follow-up. A SOAR focuses on automating the handling and responding to security events operations once an alert or condition has been triggered.\nThe critical difference is that Hobi can programmatically query data sources for point-in-time context (cloud resource tags, Okta metadata, etc.) that can be used in alert processing and response. It helps eliminate the need for things like lookup tables (and all of their problems) by reaching out to an authoritative data source and allowing for employee feedback on alerts related to them.\nHobi doesn't replace a SOAR but rather complements it by providing additional actionable data.\nHow Hobi creates context\nHobi is split into two primary services:\nAn API that returns the context about a given alert.\nA SlackBot for interactive use or gathering user feedback regarding an alert.\nHow the Hobi API endpoints are used\nHobi can be reached via API endpoints, accessible as a regular web request. This means it can be called manually, as a part of a script, or embedded within any code. Adding and accessing a new data source or type is fairly straightforward:\nWe write a small Python module to interface with a service's native API. The module specifies the types of supported indicators (IP, email, URL, domain, etc.) and contains the processing logic for returning helpful context.\nWe add a new Hobi API endpoint to call that specific module, enabling targeted context collection (for example, /okta/user) from a single tool.\nMore API endpoints that reference particular modules that return specific data for desired use cases (for example, IP-searching endpoints, user-searching endpoints, tool-specific endpoints, etc.) can be created.\nUsers and services can get an access key and begin querying data about indicators and resources.\nThis exact workflow is how we leverage Hobi in our SIEM detections.\nHow the Hobi SlackBot works\nThe general flow goes as follows:\nOur SlackBot reads the basic details of a new alert that pops into Slack from our SIEM\nIt then spiders out to all the log sources we have connected and finds relevant information on the alert and any matching previous activity.\nHobi reports any new contextual information and uses historical data to decide whether the alert is likely a false positive or not.\nHobi then pings either the user/team or our team Detection and Response in Slack with the decision and action.\nThe flow completes the feedback loop and reduces manual work, as Hobi can self-resolve alerts or reach out to parties when needed.\nWe're always improving Hobi\nHobi collates all the alert determinations and provides a report to our SIEM. This report will help us identify which alerts need improvements based on the true/false positive ratio.\nWe will continue developing new modules for Hobi and expand the sources and types of data it can gather. Hobi is still young, and we're excited to see where it will be a year from now!\nAnd as for the name? The team named our new context engine Hobi as a nod to one of my interests, K-Pop. Hobi is the nickname for an artist I admire. I lived in Korea for a while, so naturally, this fell into place.",

        "content1": "Ever wished for a personal assistant to help you manage your schedule? I know I have. With the constant overlap of meetings, events that happen outside of my working hours, and a deluge of communication in Slack, it can become overwhelming to keep everything organized and on track.\nFortunately, I've been testing out a brand new way to do the heavy lifting for me: by creating my own version of ChatGPT with OpenAI's GPTs and Zapier's AI actions. \nThe combination of the two allows you to build a custom GPT directly in ChatGPT that pulls in the power of Zapier's 6,000+ apps. That means you can take action in apps like Slack or Google Calendar\u2014all from within ChatGPT's interface. \nPicture this: I built my very own Google Calendar GPT that lets me ask about upcoming events on my calendar, send messages to team members about my schedule in Slack, and even search the web for information about meeting attendees. \nHere's how you can build your own from scratch. \nWant to test out the calendar assistant GPT before you build your own? Try out the live demo.\nBefore you get started\nYou'll need a Zapier account to get started. It's free to sign up. \nYou'll also need a ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise account. Already have the required account type? Click Log in to start chatting. \nIf you're having trouble logging in, your best bet is to reload your page. For specific login issues, check out OpenAI's troubleshooting tips.\nSet up your Zapier AI actions\nFirst, we'll need to create and enable the AI actions you want your GPT to perform directly within Zapier. This refers to setting up the apps and the relevant actions you want your GPT to have access to. For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll be adding two actions: Find a Google Calendar event and send a direct message in Slack. \nHead over to https://actions.zapier.com/gpt/actions/ to get started. \nOnce you've opened this page, click Add a new action. You'll see this window:\nType Google Calendar into the search bar, and select Google Calendar: Find Event. \nNow it's time to customize your Google Calendar action. The first three fields (Action, Zapier Account, and Google Calendar Account) will be auto-populated. You shouldn't need to edit them, but you can connect a different Google Calendar account if you need to. \nUnder Calendar, you can decide to either have AI guess a value or set a specific value for this field. I recommend this second option so you can select your exact calendar base.   \nOnce you've finished customizing these fields, click Show all options. \nScroll down the list until you see the Action Name field. \nType in an action name and use something specific, like Google Calendar: Find Event. You'll need to use this exact action name later on in your GPT setup, so keep it handy.\nNext, before you enable the action, you'll need to copy the string of digits inside the URL. This is the action ID you'll need to give your GPT later on, so remember to save it somewhere.\nOnce you've done that, click Enable action. You'll be brought back to the page listing all of your AI actions. \nNext, let's carry out the same steps for our Slack action. Click Add a new action and type Slack into the search bar. Select Slack: Send Direct Message. \nRemember to connect your specific Slack account. Then you can have the AI guess the values for the usernames and the message text. When you're interacting with your GPT, you can tell it what to write and who to send the message to, so having AI guess the field is a more flexible option. \nLike before, click Show all options. \nScroll down until you find the Send as a bot? option. I recommend setting a specific value for this field and selecting No from the dropdown menu. If you leave it set to the default setting, any message your GPT sends will be shown as a bot (and you won't be able to see the sent message). If you choose No, this message will come from you\u2014which is what we want in this case. \nNext, remember to add a name under Action Name. Mine will be Slack: Send Direct Message. \nOnce again, copy the action ID from the URL and save it somewhere, then click Enable action. \nCreate your custom GPT\nOnce you've created your AI actions, log into ChatGPT and head over to the sidebar and click Explore. Next, click Create a GPT.\nThe GPT builder will display a split screen: the Create panel is where you enter your prompts to build your chatbot; the Preview panel allows you to interact with your chatbot as you build, making it easier to determine how to refine it.\nTo get started, you can enter your instructions in the message box of the Create page. If you need inspiration or want to ask it what it can do, you can type it out here. \nBecause I want to create a calendar assistant that can connect to both my Slack and Google Calendar accounts, I'll type out the instructions in the message box. This will serve to give it context. \nOnce you've typed out your instructions, press Enter. \nThe GPT builder will then suggest a few things based on your instructions: a chatbot name, profile picture, and default conversation starters.\nThe GPT builder will prompt you to enter more specific instructions to fine-tune your chatbot's behavior. The more context you give it, the more prompts and conversation starters the GPT will generate in the Preview panel, like so:\nYou can test your chatbot\u2014interact with it how you normally would\u2014and use its responses to inform your modifications.  \nNote: These preliminary instructions serve to give your GPT context, but it won't connect your apps for you. We'll cover how to do this below. \nConfigure your GPT\nNow it's time to configure your GPT with more advanced instructions. Click Configure on  your GPT builder screen. \nIf you don't like the name and description the GPT builder generated, you can change your chatbot's name and description in the relevant fields.\nYou can also change the profile picture by clicking on the image and uploading either the relevant file from your computer or by using DALL\u00b7E.\nConfigure your instructions\nOnce you've finished customizing these fields, scroll down to the Instructions field. You can update the instructions generated by the GPT builder or enter additional instructions and guidelines on how your chatbot should or shouldn't behave. \nIn our case, I'm going to add specific instructions for how the GPT should format its output, which kinds of events it should pull from my calendar, and what information it should pull from the internet. Here's an example: \nNext, you'll need to tell your GPT builder how to interact with your Zapier actions\u2014the ones you set up earlier. These instructions should detail each step your GPT will take as it searches for a Google Calendar event, for example, or searches for a Slack user to message. \nDon't worry if you're not sure what to write. I recommend copying and pasting our Zapier example below directly into your Instructions field, but you can also check out our AI actions help documentation for more information and examples of instructions. Remember, these rules are just a starting point, so feel free to experiment!\n### Rules:\n- Before running any Actions tell the user that they need to reply after the Action completes to continue. \n### Instructions for Zapier Custom Action: \nStep 1. Tell the user you are checking they have the Zapier AI Actions needed to complete their request. Then proceed to step 2. \nStep 2. Call /list exposed actions/ to make a list: EXPOSED ACTIONS and proceed to Step 3\nStep 3. Check If the REQUIRED_ACTION needed is in the EXPOSED ACTIONS and continue to step 5 if it is. If not, continue to step 3.\nStep 3. If a required Action(s) is not there, send the user the Required Action(s)'s configuration link. Tell them to let you know when they've enabled the Zapier AI Action.\nStep 5. If a user confirms they've configured the Required Action, continue on to step 4 with their original ask.\nStep 4. Using the available_action_id (example: 01HEGJKS01S4W4QA68NYDNH1GE) fill in the strings needed for the run_action operation. Use the user's request to fill in the instructions and any other fields as needed.\nRemember to copy and paste this text directly below your other instructions, like so:\nNext, you need to add in information from your required actions\u2014this refers to the apps (Slack and Google Calendar) you enabled in a previous step. \nThe information you need is the name you gave each of your Slack and Google Calendar actions and the string of numbers you copied from the URLs. This is how you should format it: \nREQUIRED_ACTIONS:\n- Action: Google Calendar: Find Event\n- {available_action_id}:  01HGXB62CKJNVS5VH9Q5NBWJBC\n- Action: Slack: Send Direct Message \n- {available_action_id}: 01HGXDNKK5J9JDYNXDFJR1Q69R\n Copy and paste this information into your GPT instructions, below your rules. \nOnce you're done, exit the instructions field and head back into your GPT builder. (Your instructions will save automatically.)\nAdd conversation starters, upload files, and add capabilities\nHead back to your Configure panel. Under Conversation starters, you can click X beside any prompt to remove it or enter a new prompt in an empty field. Remember, these are the example prompts you or your users will see when you open the finished GPT. \nYou can also add any company files you have to your GPT in the Knowledge field. For example, you might want to upload your company's style guide or any customer service PDFs you have to give it additional context. In my case, I'll leave it blank. \nNext, check to make sure that your GPT can browse the web as we want our calendar assistant to access information from LinkedIn and other sites. To do this, enable Web Browsing. \nAdd the necessary actions to your GPT\nNow it's time to officially connect your GPT to your Zapier AI actions, which will bring all your apps together. Click Create new action. \nThis will bring you to the actions page, which looks like this:\nFirst up, copy this special URL to your clipboard: \nhttps://actions.zapier.com/gpt/api/v1/dynamic/openapi.json?tools=meta\nYou can copy this URL from this blog post or from the Zapier instructions, located here. (You'll only need to use this URL once in your GPT set-up.)\nInside your GPT builder, click Import from URL. \nPaste in your special URL in the empty HTTPS field and click Import. \nThis will generate text inside the Schema box, which defines the components and paths available in the API. \nImportant: You should now click Save in the top-right corner of your GPT builder.\nYou'll be able to select who you want to share your custom chatbot with: Only me, Only people with a link, or Public. If you're on an Enterprise plan, you'll also have Anyone at [your company] as an option. \nOnce you've enabled your choice, click Confirm to publish your GPT. \nTest your GPT\nNow that we've finished configuring our GPT, it's time to test it out and make sure everything's working correctly. After you've saved your GPT, you'll be able to click View GPT.\nThis will open the public front-end page of your GPT. \nTo test your GPT, ask it a question about your schedule. This will kick your AI actions into gear. Just remember that you'll have to click Sign in with actions.zapier.com to grant your GPT access to your Zapier account. \nThis will take you to another window where you can enable OpenAI to access your Zapier account. Click Allow.\nYou'll be taken back to your GPT. Now, thanks to the rules you set up in your GPT, it will first check to make sure that specific Google Calendar action is available:\nClick Allow. \nYour GPT will now scan your calendar and send your full agenda to you, according to how you set up your formatting earlier:\nNow because I have an overlap in my schedule, I'm going to test out my Slack action and let someone know I won't be attending the Content monthly meeting.\nOnce your GPT confirms the Slack message, make sure to double-check that it got sent in Slack.\nFinally, I'd like to test the GPT's web browser function, using myself as an example:\nYou might use this function, for example, when a new guest outside of your company gets added to a meeting and you'd like to know more about them. You might want to research a customer, a guest attendee, or even pull up recent news about a company itself.\nIf you're happy with the way everything is working, you're now ready to use your assistant. If something looks off or you want to modify the GPT's instructions, go back and edit your GPT. \nTo do this, just click into the dropdown menu of your Google Calendar Assistant and click Edit GPT. \nThis will bring you to the backend of your GPT where you can continue refining. If you want to share your GPT with other people, just click Copy link and you can share that URL with the rest of your team.\nBuild GPTs that pull in the power of thousands of apps\nWith Zapier AI Actions and OpenAI's GPT-builder, you can build custom assistants that can help streamline the way you work across thousands of apps\u2014boosting your productivity. \nThis is just the start of what you can do. Start experimenting now and see what you can build!\nRelated reading:\nCreate custom versions of ChatGPT with GPTs and Zapier\nHow to automate ChatGPT\nCreate a digital assistant with Zapier and AI",

        "content": "I've used MailerLite for years and have tested ConvertKit extensively. In this article, I'll break down the pros and cons of each platform to help you decide which is best for you.",
        "content1": "Email marketing tools usually come in one of two flavors: small business or enterprise. \nMailerLite falls in the small business bucket. But ConvertKit, which is specifically built for online creators, is an exception. Its narrow focus allows ConvertKit to populate its platform with creator-focused features you can't find anywhere else. Even so, there's enough overlap between MailerLite and ConvertKit that it can be hard to decide between them.\nAutomate your email marketing\nReach your audience\nI've used MailerLite for years and have tested ConvertKit extensively. I spent more time in each app to compare them head to head, and here, I'll break down the pros and cons of each platform to help you decide which is best for you.\nMailerLite vs. ConvertKit at a glance\nHere's a quick rundown of the difference between these two tools:\nMailerLite is best for small businesses on a budget, and it comes with an excellent free plan for anyone just getting started. It's easy to use but still powerful, and offers compelling design, automation, and analytics features.\nConvertKit is designed for solo creators like authors, bloggers, coaches, course creators, musicians, newsletter creators, podcasters, and YouTubers. If you're aiming to grow and monetize your audience, you'll find an impressive set of tools to help.\nMailerLite\nConvertKit\nEase of use\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Easy-to-use design features, templates, and automation workflows make email marketing simple.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 No drag-and-drop design, but otherwise intuitive; reusable blocks make it faster to design emails.\nSegmentation\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Multiple subscriber lists make organization easy, but it doesn't offer ConvertKit's flexibility or power.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Intuitive tagging and segmentation features allow hyper-targeted campaigns.\nAutomation\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Automations are included for users of the free plan. Visual automation builder is capable, but it can be overkill for simpler automation needs.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Automations in ConvertKit are quick to set up\u2014with user-friendly features like \"if this, then that\" rules\u2014and the visual automation builder creates powerful workflows.\nAudience growth and monetization\n\u2b50\u2b50 No built-in newsletter growth tools and weak monetization capabilities.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Built-in recommendation engine for growth; easy to sell digital products and get sponsorships.\nAnalytics\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Only the essentials, but an excellent user interface embeds analytics where you most need them.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Decent enough for most users, though not particularly in-depth; optional deliverability reporting add-on.\nPricing\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 A full-featured \"forever free\" plan; affordable paid plans are accessible for small businesses.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Excellent free plan; ConvertKit's paid plans, while good value, are around 2x pricer than MailerLite.\nIntegrations\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 140+ native integrations; also integrates with Zapier.\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 120+ native integrations; also integrates with Zapier.\nMailerLite is incredibly easy to use\nCore to the MailerLite team's philosophy is an approach that \"removes complexity while still offering advanced features.\" This minimalist approach works wonders from a user experience perspective: navigating MailerLite is easy, all features are where you expect they'll be, and the product's learning curve is short. Whether you're crafting automations or reviewing your analytics, MailerLite's user interface is always intuitive.\nStart to design an email, for example, and you're presented with a drag-and-drop interface that will be familiar to anyone who's used popular tools like Squarespace or WordPress.\nMailerLite makes it simple to design emails from scratch, but most users will opt for one of its 70 email templates. A few basic AI features, like a text generator and subject generator, can also speed up the email writing process by helping you break through writer's block.\nConvertKit is nearly as straightforward as MailerLite, especially if you're part of its target audience: its email templates and pre-built automations are fine-tuned for creator-specific needs. And innovative features like Snippets\u2014reusable blocks of content and inline text\u2014help you save time by reusing frequently-used portions of emails. (Snippets are perfect for standardizing the calls-to-action you use across your emails, for example.)\nConvertKit's main source of confusion is its email editor, which doesn't follow the industry standard of drag-and-drop widgets. If you're coming from nearly any other email editor, you might have moments of confusion like I did. Want to add an image? There's no image widget on the sidebar; instead, you create a new block and choose image from the dropdown list. \nMeanwhile, email design options are relatively sparse. The basics are there\u2014buttons, various layouts, images\u2014but MailerLite boasts a more impressive set of features, like interactive menus and integrated surveys.\nThe end result? ConvertKit's email design process feels a bit more limiting than MailerLite's, and definitely less customizable. Part of this is intentional: ConvertKit has a strong focus on deliverability and claims a 99.73% deliverability rate. Minimalistic emails help avoid spam filters: a pure text email will have higher deliverability than an email stacked with media and code.\nWhile ConvertKit doesn't have many templates\u201415 at current count\u2014they're all excellent. And ConvertKit's Marketplace features more designs, many of them free.\nConvertKit's segmentation features make it easier to organize your audience\nConvertKit replaces the traditional email contact list with tags. Organizing your subscribers using tags is more flexible, and makes it easier and quicker to spin up new, custom segments based on the needs of each email campaign. You can also set up rules to automatically assign tags, such as when a subscriber opens a particular email. This opens the door to hyper-targeted campaigns sent to people who've interacted with your content in a specific way.\nTo send an email to anyone from the U.S. who downloaded my newsletter's lead magnet, for example, it's easy to create a segment quickly using the relevant tags.\nMailerLite has a similar tagging feature\u2014called \"interest groups\"\u2014and theoretically, it lets you do a lot of the same things. But in practice, it's more complicated. Assigning tags to subscribers automatically, for example, is as simple as adding an \"if this, then that\" rule in ConvertKit. That same process feels overengineered in MailerLite, where you have to use the visual editor to create a dedicated automation just for that purpose.\nUsing MailerLite, it's simple enough to tag subscribers based on their signup source, and create segments that automatically populate with subscribers who meet those conditions. But in general, navigating those features is less flexible and takes more work than in ConvertKit.\nConvertKit's automation features are more versatile, but you get automation for free with MailerLite\nBoth products have powerful email automation features, but ConvertKit comes out ahead\u2014although MailerLite is your only choice if you want automations on the free plan.\nMailerLite's visual automation designer makes it easy to build each step in your workflow, and it includes a few features ConvertKit lacks\u2014namely, multi-trigger workflows and the ability to A/B test the individual emails in your automation.\nCompare it head-to-head with ConvertKit, though, and MailerLite feels sluggish. It's hampered by the fact that it requires every type of automation to run through the same visual automation builder. The result is that for some tasks\u2014like automatically adding a custom tag, or sending a single welcome email\u2014creating an automation in MailerLite takes longer than it should.\nConvertKit takes a different approach, breaking the task of \"automation\" into three features:\nRules: Simple \"if this, then that\" rules for actions like tagging subscribers when certain events happen.\nSequences: Multiple emails that are sent in order, spaced out with flexible intervals of time. If you're building a simple email drip campaign, this is all you need.\nVisual automations: For creating powerful funnels that string together rules, email sequences, triggers, and integrations.\nYou can create simple ConvertKit automation using Rules in a matter of seconds.\nCreating Sequences in ConvertKit is also refreshingly simple: the tool offers single-window editing, allowing you to create your entire email series without jumping between screens. For more complex workflows, there are 28 thoughtfully-designed automation templates that you'll love if you're a creator. Each is focused on real-world scenarios, like \"Welcome subscribers to your podcast\" and \"Pitch your book with a free chapter,\" making it easy to get up and running fast.\nConvertKit is designed to help you grow your audience and monetize\nConvertKit's niched-down audience of creators has enabled the company to focus on innovative features its target audience really cares about. For most users, that means two things: growing faster and making money.\nTake audience growth, for example. Newsletter discoverability is a massive challenge: most businesses rely on funneling users from social media or their website to email. But ConvertKit came up with a different solution: the Creator Network, which helps you grow faster by getting referrals from newsletters with similar audiences.\nImage from ConvertKit\nImproving your email signup conversion rate is another key way to boost subscribers. Lead magnets can help with this, but rolling out different lead magnets across your site can be a headache. I've hacked a solution together on MailerLite, but it's messy: you have to host lead magnets on your website, move subscribers into groups based on their signup form, and then create a unique automation that delivers the lead magnet. ConvertKit makes this way easier by including an \"incentive email\" as a feature within its forms, and by hosting and delivering the lead magnet for you.\nMonetization is another area where ConvertKit shows serious strength. While MailerLite lets you sell products and run a paid newsletter via a Stripe integration, the execution feels clunky by comparison. If your goal is to make money with your email list, ConvertKit wins by a landslide.\nIt's easy to set up digital products and get paid with ConvertKit Commerce, ConvertKit's all-in-one commerce solution. Plus, an \"automatic content upgrades\" feature helps nudge users to upgrade from free to paid products.\nConvertKit offers plenty of other ways you can make money, too:\nUpselling subscribers to a paid newsletter\nRecommending other newsletters in the ConvertKit Creator Network\nAdding sponsored ads to your emails, which ConvertKit facilitates with its Sponsor Network\nTip jars to give your audience another way to support you\nConvertKit also has a handy potential revenue calculator showing how much you might make with various money-earning features enabled, depending on the size and growth of your email list. (According to the calculator, a list of 10,000 people monetized via premium subscribers, newsletter recommendations, and sponsorships might earn up to $6,000 per month.)\nMailerLite offers more advanced analytics\nNeither MailerLite nor ConvertKit are analytics powerhouses, but MailerLite definitely has the edge here. ConvertKit offers a level of analytics that's decent enough for most users: you can see stats for individual emails, as well as for each email within an automation. And if you upgrade to ConvertKit's Pro plan, you can get deliverability reporting that shows how many emails are actually reaching their destination.\nBut generally, it's pretty basic: you can see your open rate, click rate, which links were clicked, and which subscribers opened your email.\nConvertKit could offer much more in terms of data visualization, as MailerLite does with its chart showing at which hour of the day subscribers opened each campaign, or its interactive map showing their location. Little touches like this make MailerLite's analytics fun to explore, and easier to get useful insights from.\nMailerLite generates an email heatmap to see where users click, and its analytics also appear contextually where they're needed to help you make decisions\u2014for example, next to each email in an automation.\nMailerLite has a better free plan, and its paid plans offer excellent value\nFor budget-conscious email senders, MailerLite is a no-brainer. Its \"forever free\" plan, which covers you until you hit 1,000 subscribers, includes features like email automations and advanced reporting. Meanwhile, its entry level paid plan is $15/month for 1,000 subscribers, while ConvertKit costs $29/month for 1,000 subscribers. For 5,000 subscribers, you'll pay $39/month for MailerLite and $79/month for ConvertKit.\nWhile ConvertKit isn't the cheapest option, it offers a ton of value for creators and anyone else who can benefit from its unique monetization and audience growth features. It also has an impressive free plan if your list is under 1,000 subscribers\u2014though you'll need to upgrade if you want to automate your emails.\nBoth integrate well with other software\nWith MailerLite's 140+ integrations and ConvertKit's 120+ integrations, it's easy to connect both of these platforms with other apps. MailerLite has strong integrations with CRMs, eCommerce platforms, and form software, while ConvertKit's native integrations are tailored more toward creator-centered platforms like Kajabi and Teachable.\nBoth MailerLite and ConvertKit integrate with Zapier, which means you can also connect them to thousands of other apps.

If you're not sure which to go with, here are a few suggestions to keep in mind.\nGo with ConvertKit if you sell digital products or if you're a solo creator, like a blogger, author, or course creator. You'll get newsletter growth and monetization features you can't find anywhere else, and the platform's segmentation, automation, and templates are designed to make your life easier.\nChoose MailerLite if you run a small business that isn't focused on digital products. It's also the best choice for most free users, who get a more full-featured plan up to 1,000 subscribers.\nRelated reading:\nEmail marketing best practices\nThe best free email marketing services\nEmail marketing ideas to use for your next campaign",

        "content": "The best productivity apps for iPhone make possible something that would otherwise be impossible, or they make something you need to do simpler and faster.",
        "content1": "I'm always looking for iPhone apps that make it easier to get things done on the go. And with no shortage of options on the App Store, I can afford to be choosy. So can you.\n5 things you should automate today\nStart automating\nI've been an iPhone user since the early days, and over the past decade or so, I've downloaded (and deleted) hundreds of iPhone productivity apps.\nBased on my experiences with iPhone productivity, plus the support of dozens of hours of testing from the Zapier team, here are my picks for the best productivity apps for iPhone.\nThe best productivity iPhone apps at a glance\nCategory\nStandout feature\nThings\nTask tracking\nInbox approach to tasks\nOutlook\nEmail\nFocused inbox\nFantastical\nCalendar\nApple ecosystem focus\nFreedom\nDistraction blocking\nCross-platform distraction blocking\nStreaks\nHabit tracking\nInteractive home screen widget\nSnapseed\nPhoto editing\nAdvanced photo editing features for free\nDay One\nJournaling\nTemplate gallery\nPocket\nRead-it-later\nArticle discovery\nSorted^3\nScheduling\nHyper-scheduling\nAdobe Acrobat\nPDF editing\nFeature-rich editing on PDFs\n1Password\nPassword management\nFace ID/Touch ID support\nWhat to look for in the best iPhone productivity apps\nApple adheres to a very specific design language on the iPhone, and the best apps reflect that. A productivity app on your iPhone should feel like it belongs on iOS and iOS alone, even when cross-platform versions exist. Here's what that means:\nIt should be intuitive, just like the iPhone and all things Apple.\nIt should incorporate the swipes and taps you've already committed to muscle memory.\nIt should make good use of space. The interface should be clean and attractive, and additional functionality should be cleverly tucked behind context-based actions like long presses and floating menus.\nIt should be stable, with consistent updates and a reliable developer. You don't want your favorite productivity app constantly glitching or suddenly disappearing.\nReally, you might not even need to open the best app to interact with it. Through the use of home screen widgets, Siri, and share sheet extensions, the best iPhone productivity apps slot right into your workflow.\nWhat about the iPhone's built-in productivity apps?\nThe iPhone comes with a whole suite of built-in productivity apps and tools. Some include Mac counterparts, and some are even accessible on Windows or Android using web apps. Others are relegated to the Settings menu but perform ridiculously useful functions.\nIf you exclusively use Apple platforms, Apple's dedicated apps are great options. Some are just as good if not better than their premium non-Apple counterparts\u2014in particular, Notes and Reminders. There's a reason these apps frequently come out on top in lists of the best iPhone apps\u2014and Apple continually improves them with each yearly iOS revision.\nSo before you look at the other iPhone productivity apps I'm recommending, it's absolutely worth checking out these native Apple apps:\nNotes is a powerful note-taking app with collaborative features, the ability to link between notes, and a built-in document scanner.\nReminders is a to-do list system with sharing capabilities that lets you assign tasks, trigger reminders based on time or location, and add extra details like sub-tasks, URLs, and images to your list.\nCalendar is Apple's simple built-in calendar. It syncs with most major calendar services and includes inbox functionality for accepting invites and reviewing new appointments.\nMail, like its counterpart Mac app, has a clean interface and powerful features for snoozing, scheduling, unsending, and filtering messages.\nFreeform is one of Apple's lesser-known productivity apps. It's an interactive canvas on which you can brainstorm, diagram, and share ideas.\nReading List is a read-it-later service built into Safari. Simply hit the Share button, choose Reading List, and then recall items later using the Bookmarks menu.\nDictation lets you talk instead of typing\u2014in any application. Just tap the microphone icon in the bottom-right corner of the keyboard and start talking (or swap between talking and typing without disabling dictation).\nShortcuts allows you to download or build your own powerful workflows using built-in apps and services, and automate things like enabling Do Not Disturb mode.\nVoice Memos is the iPhone's voice recording app, and it has a built-in iCloud integration that pushes notes to your other devices.\nFocus is a Settings feature that lets you automatically silence notifications, calls, and messages from all but your allowed list of contacts.\nSpotlight is the iPhone's built-in search function. Pull down on your home screen and type anything, from app names to Settings panels, to get there faster. It can even do currency conversion and simple math.\nScreen recording is easy on the iPhone. Just add it to your Control Center, and tap the record button when you're ready. All your recordings are saved in your Photos app.\niCloud Keychain lets you keep all of your login credentials safe and synced between devices and quickly fills in authenticator codes for you.\nBackground Sounds are also built in\u2014no white noise app required.\nIf Apple's built-in productivity apps and tools aren't doing it for you, though, here are my picks for not-built-by-Apple iPhone productivity apps that are worth the download.\nThe best iPhone productivity app for tracking tasks\nThings\nHaving your to-do list on your phone isn't a luxury\u2014it's a necessity. Things is a $9.99 download that excels by taking an \"Inbox\" approach to tasks.\nAdd items quickly, and then decide whether to do them today, add them to projects, or schedule them for later. Set up repeating tasks, add deadlines, organize by tag, and divide your lists into sections. Use the share sheet extension to add items from anywhere, or forward tasks via email to see them appear in your list.\nThings is available for iPhone, iPad, and macOS, so it's no surprise that it feels right at home on Apple platforms. If you're looking for something similar with more cross-platform appeal, Todoist is feature-rich and available everywhere.

In what might be a surprising turn of events, Microsoft Outlook is the best alternative to Apple Mail. It incorporates the whole package, including support for Exchange, Office 365, Outlook.com, Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud accounts.\nAt the heart of Outlook is the Focused inbox, where Microsoft decides which messages deserve the most attention. Train this feature by using the Move to Focused Inbox option within a message context menu. While scrolling your inbox, you can use customizable swipes to quickly archive, delete, mark as unread, or snooze your messages.\nSince this is Outlook, there's a solid built-in calendar and a ton of customization options, from colors to default actions when tapping links. You can also use Siri Shortcuts or connect to other services like cloud storage providers with Add-Ins. \nLooking for a faster, \"inbox zero\" approach to mail on your iPhone? Give Triage a try.

If you use Apple's Calendar and Reminders app, Fantastical can also pull in information from both and display them in a single interface.\nThe app uses natural language input so that you can type (or dictate) events like \"lunch with Chris tomorrow at noon,\" and the app will make sense of it. Fantastical will even work out time zones for you, so you don't miss events. Upgrade to premium for $4.75/month (billed annually) to get unlimited calendars, collaboration, and meeting detection, among other features.\nFantastical may be one of the best iPhone calendar apps, but it's not the only app to combine your to-do list and schedule. Any.do is another solid choice for managing your life from a single interface. If you're looking for something a bit different that focuses on minimalism, take a look at Dawn. Or check out Zapier's list of all the best iPhone calendar apps for more options.\nFantastical price: Free; upgrade to Premium for $4.75/month (billed annually) for additional productivity, scheduling, and collaboration features\nThe best iPhone productivity app for blocking distractions\nFreedom\nYour phone is built to distract you, and sometimes it's easier to block the apps and websites that you struggle with rather than relying on willpower alone. On an iPhone, that can be difficult since so much of iOS is tightly controlled, but Freedom can help.\nFreedom is a cross-platform distraction blocker that works as well on iPhone as it does on Windows, macOS, or Android. By granting the app a few permissions and installing the Freedom VPN profile, you can control sessions from a single device. That means you can trigger Freedom on your Mac and block distractions on your iPhone at the same time.\nFreedom is free to try but costs $8.99/month or $39.99/year. With your subscription, you'll get the ability to schedule blocks and access to focus sounds to help boost productivity. If you don't need such a nuclear option, Session is a Pomodoro Technique app that includes basic distraction blocking options too. Or you can check out Zapier's picks for the best distraction blocking apps for more options.\nFreedom price: $8.99/month or $39.99/year\nThe best iPhone productivity app for habit tracking\nStreaks\nA dedicated habit-tracking app like Streaks can help you break bad habits, form good ones, and maintain pace over time. This Apple Design Award winner is an App Store mainstay that makes it easy to track up to 24 daily tasks. \nCreate your own custom tasks, assign them a unique icon, and check them off in-app or using an interactive Home Screen widget. Alternatively, use Apple Health data to automatically meet targets like a daily step count or energy burned.\nStreaks is great for tracking everything from brushing your teeth to checking your email. The $4.99 purchase includes iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and even a Mac app, with device syncing via iCloud. If you love Streaks and want to apply the format to fitness, try Streaks Workout to build a short workout plan. Or, if Streaks isn't quite what you're looking for, take a look at Zapier's picks for the best habit tracking apps.\nStreaks price: $4.99\nThe best iPhone productivity app for photo editing\nSnapseed\nApple's Photos app is a surprisingly powerful photo editor for making basic edits and applying simple filters, but it has its limits. A good third-party photo editor is essential for more in-depth editing or simply to access a different set of features. Google's Snapseed is a great choice\u2014and it's completely free to use.\nSnapseed's simple interface makes editing a breeze. You can apply pre-existing filters for an instant look, or go into more depth using a full suite of editing tools. You can make all of the usual photo editing adjustments to brightness, contrast, shadows, and so on, along with a range of extras for adjusting perspective, tweaking curves, adding grain, applying selective blur, and inserting text and frames.\nThe app doubles as a RAW editor, with the ability to export as JPEG for quick sharing. If you want even more powerful tools and you're willing to pay, Adobe Lightroom has some very smart AI-powered tools, premium filters, and the ability to batch edit your images. Or you can take a look at Zapier's picks for the best mobile photo editing apps for more options.\nSnapseed price: Free\nThe best iPhone productivity app for journaling\nDay One\nYou could keep a journal in your note-taking app of choice, but using a purpose-built app will help you stick to the routine: it reminds you to write, prompts you for your thoughts, and arranges your entries in a digestible format. For iPhone users, the best journaling app is Day One.\nRecord your thoughts, save photos and videos, take audio notes, and even draw or attach documents to each entry. Day One features a template gallery from which you can save outlines for later use. Set up a custom reminder notification at a time of your choosing, or rely on Day One's daily prompt notification to inspire an entry.\nYou can use Day One for free to save unlimited text-based entries, but if you want unlimited media uploads, video entries, and more, you'll need to subscribe for $9.99/month. Day One is limited to iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Android, so if you're Team Apple on your phone but Team Windows on your desktop, try Diarium instead. Or take a look at this list of the best journaling apps.\nDay One price: Free for text entries; $9.99/month for more features\nThe best iPhone productivity app for reading things later\nPocket\nIt's hard to be productive when life (read: your phone) throws so many interesting things your way all the time. But you can have your cake and eat it (later) with a solid read-it-later app like Pocket. \nSave articles to your Pocket account using your iPhone's share sheet, then access them anywhere (like on the web via your browser, or using the native Mac app). The iPhone app has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, including article discovery if you run out of things to read, and the ability to listen to your articles as if they were podcasts.\nPocket is free to use, but power users can upgrade for $4.99/month to permanently save items (even if they go offline) and access advanced search features. Instapaper is another compelling choice, with a speed-reading feature for getting through articles in record time. Or you can try another of Zapier's picks for the best read-it-later apps.\nBy connecting Pocket to Zapier, you open up a whole world of possibilities to automate your read-it-later workflows. Here are some ideas for how to get more out of Pocket, or you can get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\nSave hot new Reddit posts on Pocket\nTry it\nCreate Todoist tasks from Pocket items\nTry it\nPocket price: Free; from $4.99/month for advanced features\nThe best iPhone productivity app for scheduling your day\nSorted^3\nCreating a list of things that need to be done isn't always enough\u2014sometimes you need structure to kickstart your day. Your iPhone is the perfect device, since it's always with you, whatever you're doing. You can use it as a work tool, or as an aid for maintaining a healthy work-life balance by scheduling downtime too.\nSorted^3 is one of the best time-blocking apps, and it's made exclusively for Apple devices. The app specializes in hyper-scheduling, where every task is given a precise time slot, and you're notified when it's time to move on to the next. Perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to auto-schedule everything in just two taps.\nYou can assign durations to your items, flesh out each task entry with details about what needs to be done (and even add headers, checkboxes, highlights, and tags). There's also a nifty \"time ruler\" that you can use to schedule tasks quickly by tapping and dragging. Sorted^3 is free, but some of the more useful features, like auto-scheduling and iCloud Sync, require a $14.99 one-off upgrade.\nIf you want something a little more powerful that also has web and Android versions, Sunsama is a solid choice. Or check out these picks for the best time-blocking apps.\nSorted^3 price: Free; $14.99 for more useful features\nThe best iPhone productivity app for editing PDFs\nAdobe Acrobat\nApple's built-in PDF editing tools leave much to be desired, especially if you want to perform more advanced actions like reorganizing pages. The best PDF editors are usually premium apps, and that's also the case on mobile platforms like the iPhone. Adobe Acrobat is the original PDF editor, and the iPhone version has a full suite of reading and editing features.\nThe free version is limited to tools for reading and annotating. This includes collaboration and sharing, marking up documents with drawings and highlights, and the ability to fill out forms and sign your name. Integration with Google Drive, the Adobe Scan app, and Adobe's \"Liquid Mode\" reading experience make this a formidable freebie.\nTo edit PDFs, you'll need a $9.99 premium membership, which unlocks full PDF editing. Change text, switch out images, merge documents, use custom fonts, and use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert scans to selectable text. You can also compress PDFs to save space or convert to different file types including Microsoft Word and images like JPEG and PNG.\nIf you're looking for a more affordable app with a slightly less impressive feature set, try PDF Expert instead. Or take a look at these picks for the best PDF editing apps.\nAdobe Acrobat price: Free; $9.99 for full editing capabilities\nThe best iPhone productivity app for managing your passwords\n1Password\nYour iPhone can store and sync login credentials over iCloud with your other devices (including Windows if you install iCloud for Windows). For Apple users, this functionality works really well, but if you prefer other platforms, things aren't so rosy. 1Password is a password manager that behaves seamlessly on all platforms\u2014and feels like a native tool on iOS. \nApps and websites can pull from your 1Password database, so there's no copy-pasting or app switching to worry about. You can even use Face ID or Touch ID to quickly unlock your password vault. 1Password lets you store more than just usernames and passwords: you can add payment details, addresses, document scans, and notes across multiple vaults. \nIf you're looking for solid password manager with a generous free plan, you should also consider Bitwarden. Or take a look at Zapier's other picks for the best password managers.\n1Password price: From $2.99 for individual accounts\nMore iPhone productivity ideas\nThere are endless ways to be more productive with your iPhone. For example, you might not be making the most of your iPhone home screen. Picking the right wallpaper, using the right widgets, and organizing your apps properly can help you work more efficiently. You should also ditch the unnecessary iPhone notifications. And iPhone power users who are looking to make better use of the powerful Shortcuts apps should also consider integrating Zapier into their workflows. It's as simple as telling Siri to \"start a Zap.\"\nRelated reading:\nThe best Mac productivity apps\nStop doomscrolling: 6 better ways to spend a 15-minute break on your phone\nHow I (finally) stopped looking at my phone so much\nThis article was originally published in September 2018 by Jill Duffy.

That means I try out a lot of new tools, and I know that the right productivity apps can make an actual difference in how you work.\n5 things you should automate today\nStart automating\nIf you're working in Windows, you'll want productivity apps that were purpose-built for the operating system. So based on dozens of hours of testing from the Zapier team, and my own insights from using these tools, these are the best Windows productivity apps.\nThe best Windows productivity apps at a glance\nCategory\nStandout feature\nMicrosoft To Do\nTask management\n\"My Day\" view\neM Client\nEmail\nIncredible customization\nOneNote\nNote-taking\nScrapbook style note-taking\nWindows Calendar\nCalendar\nSimple interface with enough customization\nFreedom\nDistraction blocker\nCross-platform distraction blocking\nWindows 11 Speech Recognition\nDictation\nWorks in any application\nLoom\nScreen recording\nFree and easy to use\nPowerToys Tun\nApplication launcher\nMimics Spotlight on Mac\nLightkey\nPredictive writing assistant\nLearns your typing style\nWindows Auto Dark Mode\nTheme switching\nAutomatically switches between light and dark themes\nQuickLook\nFile preview\nPreview file contents with the spacebar\n1Password\nPassword manager\nSecurely store login details and generate passwords\nWhat makes a great productivity app for Windows?\nAs a Windows user, you're used to certain ways of doing things, and the best apps should reflect this and slot neatly into your workflow. These apps should feel like they were built from the ground up for Windows, even if they weren't. \nYou want familiar keyboard shortcuts, a user interface that feels like it belongs on Microsoft's desktop, and support for native features like notifications or a useful system tray icon. Some of these apps will be cross-platform, while others don't exist anywhere but on Windows, but all of them have Windows apps that feel right.\nYou might find that some of these apps don't fit you like a glove. That's ok. Because Windows is everywhere, there are a lot of apps to choose from. So if you don't like one of the top picks, click through my other suggestions to check out the broader category.\nWith that, here are the best productivity apps for Windows.\nThe best Windows productivity app for task management\nMicrosoft To Do\nHow do you remember what you have to do if you don't write it down? A to-do list app is vital for tracking everything from short-term tasks to long-term projects (and everything in between). And it's not enough to simply record your to-dos; you need to effectively organize and access them, too.\nThe free app Microsoft To Do is a great choice for most Windows users. You can use it to organize tasks on different lists and then add items from your lists to the \"My Day\" view. If you schedule a task in advance, Microsoft To Do will even add it to the relevant day for you.\nIn addition to feeling right at home on the Windows desktop, Microsoft To Do is available almost everywhere else, including Apple devices. And you can connect it to Zapier to automate all your task management tasks. Learn more about how to automate Microsoft To Do, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\nCreate tasks on Microsoft To-Do from new Google Calendar events\nTry it\nAdd new Microsoft To Do tasks to Notion databases\nTry it\nOther Windows to-do list apps:\nIf you prefer more powerful organizational tools, take a look at Amazing Marvin. \nFor a lightweight text-based take on task management, give Sleek a shot.\nSee all of Zapier's picks for the best Windows to-do list apps.\nRead more: Automate your to-do list\nThe best Windows productivity app for email\neM Client\nA good email client empowers you to more efficiently manage your inbox. The less time you spend on email, the more time you can spend doing other things. Being able to tailor the email experience to your preferences helps you take actionable steps to do actually useful things with the messages you receive.\neM Client is one of the best Windows email clients out there. It leads the pack in terms of customization, allowing you to change everything from themes and animations to UI elements and email behaviors. It also includes modern mainstays like the ability to snooze incoming threads and use text expansion features in your replies to streamline your writing.\nYou can use eM Client in a limited capacity for free with two accounts, or pay $59.95 for the Pro upgrade to unlock the full set of features.\nOther Windows email clients:\nThe new free (ad-supported) Outlook for Windows is great\u2014and you can't really go wrong with Outlook on Windows.\nI also like the trusted and infinitely expandable Mozilla Thunderbird.\nHere's Zapier's roundup of the best Windows email clients.\nRead more: Automate your email\nThe best Windows productivity app for note-taking\nOneNote\nDigital note-taking is a superpower. You have infinite space to store thoughts, work, and plans, plus you can find everything easily with structured organization and search features. \nFor the vast majority of users, Microsoft OneNote is a solid choice. It's not just one of the best Windows note-taking apps; it's also one of the most feature-packed apps of its kind on the market. You can store everything from simple text notes to carefully constructed \"scrapbook\" style pages, drawings, files, and documents. \nYou can automate OneNote by connecting it to Zapier.

You can customize Calendar with colors and images of your choosing, and the app works with most major accounts, including Office 365, Google, Yahoo, and iCloud.\nIt's worth noting that Windows Calendar's days are numbered, with Microsoft set to replace Mail and Calendar with Outlook for Windows. This will combine everything into a single interface, with an ad-supported free version available to all. \nOther Windows calendar apps:\nFor an open-source take on the Outlook formula, Mozilla Thunderbird does a similar job.\nHere's Zapier's list of the best Windows calendar apps.\nThe best Windows productivity app for blocking distractions\nFreedom\nSometimes willpower isn't enough. That's where apps designed to help you focus come in. Nip the problem in the bud by removing the distractions, at least when you're supposed to be working.\nFreedom is an app that aims to block distractions, regardless of which device and operating system you're using. That means no more picking up your smartphone to circumvent the blocks you enabled on your Windows PC. You can hide whole categories, like social media and shopping websites, and nominate your own domains. It's an investment in your own time that'll cost you $8.99/month or $3.33/month if you sign up for a whole year. \nOther Windows distraction blockers:\nIf you only want to remove distractions from your browser, LeechBlock NG is a free solution. \nIf you're looking for something a bit more feature-rich, RescueTime is one of the best time tracking apps that includes a distraction blocker.\nHere are Zapier's picks for the best distraction blocking apps.\nThe best Windows productivity app for dictation\nWindows 11 Speech Recognition\nSpeaking aloud might not replace typing altogether, but it can vastly speed up processes like taking written notes, composing emails, and instant messaging. Some people even dictate articles (like this one) with minimal editing\u2014a skill the rest of us can only dream of.\nWindows 11 comes with built-in dictation software called Windows 11 Speech Recognition. Also known as Voice Control, it's among the best dictation software since it works in any application that's installed (and can even be used to control your Windows PC). The feature can be enabled under Settings > Time and Language > Speech and triggered using the Windows + H keyboard shortcut.\nOther Windows dictation apps:\nIf you're a heavy dictation user, you might want to invest in something a little more powerful, like Dragon by Nuance. The app is far more customizable and allows you to add and train specific words and industry vocabulary, and even transcribe from audio recordings.\nHere's a list of all of Zapier's favorite dictation apps.\nThe best Windows productivity app for screen recording\nLoom\nRather than writing down a list of instructions or talking someone through a process on a call, screen recording apps let you show rather than tell. \nLoom shines as one of the best screen recording apps across all platforms, including Windows. It has a generous free option that allows you to record short videos of five minutes or less, complete with webcam capture and AI transcriptions and summaries. You can remove these limitations with a $12.50 monthly subscription to the team plan.\nOther Windows screen recording apps:\nIf you need something fancier, Camtasia lets you produce immersive video walkthroughs using a feature-rich editor. \nHere's a full list of the best screen recording apps.\nOther Windows productivity apps\nThese apps will help you get things done, remember the important stuff, and hopefully save you some time. If you want to get even more done, here are a few extra apps to consider\u2014they've been vetted by tech experts (and some are apps I use myself every day).\nMicrosoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for customizing Windows to your liking, making the operating system a more productive place to work.\nPowerToys Run is an application launcher that mimics Spotlight on the Mac.\nLightkey is a predictive writing assistant that learns your style of typing.\nWindows Auto Dark Mode automatically switches between light and dark themes on Windows 10 and 11.\nQuickLook lets you hit spacebar to preview file contents just like the macOS feature of the same name.\nPassword managers like 1Password are essential for securely storing login details and generating secure passwords, and the desktop apps make the process a lot smoother.\nRelated reading:\nThe best productivity apps\nThe best video editing software\nEat the frog: A practical approach to reaching your goals\nThis article was originally published in July 2018 by Melanie Pinola.

While variety in your daily Starbucks order might add some spice to your life, the effort of constantly context switching between apps will quickly kill whatever productivity that caffeine boost brought you.\nInstead of jumping between your team chat app and your to-do list every time someone gives you something new to do, let automation do the busywork for you.\nWith this automated workflow\u2014we call them Zaps\u2014you can instantly create a new Trello card every time you save a message in Slack.

You can create your own Zap from scratch without any coding knowledge, but we also offer quick templates to get you started. \nIf you'd like to start with a template, click on it below, and you'll be taken to the Zap editor. You'll need to create a Zapier account if you don't already have one. Then, follow the directions below to set up your Zap.\nCreate Trello cards from new saved Slack messages\nTry it\nSet up your Slack trigger\nFirst, set up your trigger\u2014the event that starts your Zap. If you're using the Zap template, this will already be selected for you. Otherwise, search for and select Slack as the trigger app and New Saved Message as the trigger event. Click Continue.\nNext, sign in your Slack account, if you haven\u2019t already, and click Continue. \nClick Test Trigger and Zapier will create a sample saved message for you to use in setting up the rest of your Zap. Some workflows will pull in sample data from your actual apps, but this one will always show you Zapier data. Once the Zap is turned on, it will pull info from your actual apps.\nClick Continue with selected record to test your trigger step.\nSet up your Trello action\nNow, it's time to set up the action\u2014the event your Zap will perform once it's triggered.

You can map different data to these fields by clicking in them and selecting something else from the Insert Data dropdown.\nNext, you can choose to apply a color label or create a custom label for the card. In this example, we\u2019ve added the user\u2019s full name as a label, making it easier to spot the relevant card. You also have other options like adding a Trello member to the card, assigning a due date, adding attachments, and more. \nIf you know you want to include the same checklist items to any Trello cards you add from saved Slack messages, you can also define those steps in the Checklist Name and Checklist Items fields. Then the Zap will add those sub-tasks for you each time it adds a new card to Trello.\nOnce you\u2019re happy with the setup, click Continue.\nNext, click Test Step. You should see the Zapier test data in your Trello board.\nIf the card is set up how you'd like it, you're now ready to use your Zap.

Under the Recording tab, make sure both Require users to authenticate before viewing cloud recordings and Require password to access shared cloud recordings are turned off.\nYou'll also need to ensure that Allow cloud recording sharing is turned on. \nThe New Recording trigger works on cloud recordings, which are available on Zoom's paid plans. Currently, this trigger will not download password-protected meetings.\nMake sure you have a cloud recording to use as sample data\nIf you've never recorded anything to the cloud with these settings in place, start up a Zoom meeting. Under the More menu, select Record to the Cloud. It can just be a few seconds, but this will help you test and make sure your Zap works the way you want. When you end the meeting, Zoom will automatically upload the meeting to the cloud.\nSet up Google Drive\nBefore making your Zap, set up the Google Drive folder where you'd like the recordings to be saved. When you get to the last step, this will be important.\nNow you're ready to set up your Zap.\nUpload Zoom recordings to Google Drive\nZapier lets you create automated workflows called Zaps, which send your information from one app to another. You can create your own Zap from scratch without any coding knowledge, but we also offer quick templates to get you started. \nIf you'd like to start with a template, click on it below, and you'll be taken to the Zap editor. You'll need to create a Zapier account if you don't already have one. Then, follow the directions below to set up your Zap.\nUpload new Zoom recordings to Google Drive\nTry it\nSet up the Zoom trigger step\nFirst, set up your trigger\u2014the event that starts your Zap. If you're using the Zap template, this will already be selected for you. Otherwise, select Zoom as the trigger app and New Recording as the trigger event.\nClick Continue. You'll then be prompted to sign in to your Zoom account with your username if you haven't connected it before.\nFor each app you connect, Zapier will ask for a general set of permissions which allows you to be flexible with your Zaps. The only actions Zapier takes on your app accounts are those a given Zap needs to accomplish what you've set up.\nOnce you've connected your account, click Continue.\nNext, you'll be prompted to test your information. Click Test trigger. Zapier will try to find a recent new recording in your Zoom account. We'll use this as sample data to customize your workflow.\nIf Zapier can't find a new recording, create a new one in your Zoom account and test your trigger again. Though you have the option to skip the test, working with real data in your account is the best way to ensure your recording uploads correctly.\nChoose which sample you'd like to use in your test, then click Continue with selected record.\nSet up your Google Drive action step\nNow it's time to set up your action\u2014the event your Zap performs after it's triggered. Select Google Drive for your action app and Upload File for your action event. Click Continue.\nNext, connect your Google Drive account, if you haven't connected it before, then click Continue.\nYou can now customize which folder you want to upload new recordings, what file you want Zapier to upload, and what you want your file to be called.\nSelect the Drive and Folder where you want Zapier to upload your new Zoom recordings.\nNext, you'll need to populate The File field\u2014the Zap won't work if you don't. If you're using the Zap template, this will already be added for you. If not, click in the File field and select Video Files Download URL from the Insert Data dropdown.\nUnder the Convert To Document? field, click on Choose value and select False. If you were to select True, it would tell Google Drive that this file should be an editable document. Since you're uploading a video, this isn't what you need.\nBy default, Zapier will use the same name and extension as your Zoom recording for the File name field. If you want a little more specificity, you can use existing data options in Zoom, such as Start Time or Topic. To map a field, click in the field and select the available data that is listed in the dropdown menu that you want to use as your file name. \nYou can also enter in your own text, which will stay the same every time your Zap runs. However, you'll still want to map unique identifiers\u2014like the date\u2014from Zoom so you can tell your videos apart.\nCustomize everything until you're satisfied, then click Continue.\nYou'll then be asked to test your Zap, which should upload a new recording to your specified Google Drive and folder. It may take a few minutes for the video to process, depending on the size of your recording.\nIf something doesn't look right, feel free to go back and make any changes. Once you're happy with everything, you can begin using your Zap.\nNow, whenever you finish recording a Zoom meeting, the recording will automatically upload to Google Drive.\nUpload new Zoom recordings to Google Drive\nTry it\nHead to our Zoom integrations page to see what else you can do, or create your own Zap.\nUpload new Zoom recordings to Google Drive and send Gmail notifications\nWant to let Zoom attendees know the recording has been uploaded to Google Drive and is ready for them to review? All you have to do is add another action step to your Zap. Once the file is uploaded to Google Drive, the Zap will send an email from your Gmail account with the Google Drive link\u2014so all your stakeholders stay up to date. \nUpload new Zoom recordings to Google Drive and send notifications via Gmail\nTry it\nNote: This workflow requires a multi-step Zap, which are available on a paid plan or during a free trial.\nThis piece was originally published on September 22, 2020.

        "content": "Videos have dominated the web for ages, and now video marketing is becoming a necessity for any business. 87 percent of online marketers create video content, while 51 percent of them tout videos as the content with the best ROI.",
        "content1": "Videos are an integral part of the modern internet, whether they're short viral clips on TikTok, stories on Instagram, or in-depth video essays on YouTube. While social video platforms like these are great for content creators and influencers, businesses looking to share a sales demo or how-to tutorial can have different needs. Still, the benefits of video are much the same: it can humanize you and your product, engage your customers, and build brand loyalty.\nOf course, once you've shot and edited your videos, you'll need some way to display them. If you've got a team of developers, the coding chops, or use a popular website builder, you can look at hosting them directly on your own website. Otherwise, a dedicated video hosting service can make things a lot easier by handling all the optimizing and resizing necessary to get videos playing properly on smartphones, tablets, and computers. You can then embed the videos directly on your site, or share them to social media and other online platforms.\nFocus your energy on creating, and let robots do the rest\nAutomate post-production\nModern video hosting platforms have evolved from their beginnings as a simple piece of internet real estate for your videos. Now, they help you customize the look and feel of your video player, ensure your videos play smoothly across all devices and browsers, and provide marketing options from within your videos.\nI tested dozens of video hosting sites, and these are the five I recommend.\nThe best video hosting platforms for business\nYouTube for its existing viewership\nVimeo for collaboration on videos\nWistia for video marketing\nSpotlightr for quizzing your audience\nUscreen for video monetization\nWhat makes the best video hosting service?\nHow we evaluate and test apps\nAll of our best apps roundups are written by humans who've spent much of their careers using, testing, and writing about software. We spend dozens of hours researching and testing apps, using each app as it's intended to be used and evaluating it against the criteria we set for the category. We're never paid for placement in our articles from any app or for links to any site\u2014we value the trust readers put in us to offer authentic evaluations of the categories and apps we review. For more details on our process, read the full rundown of how we select apps to feature on the Zapier blog.\nI've been producing, editing, and sharing videos for more than a decade as part of my career as a tech writer. For me, the most important part of any video workflow\u2014including hosting\u2014is that it's user-friendly and consistent. Overly complex tools aren't necessary for most situations.\nIn addition to that aspect, the best online video hosting services offer a few make-or-break features that are essential for businesses:\nBasic analytics tools to measure how many people see your videos, and whether or not they're your target customers\nSEO tools to make your videos search-engine friendly\nThe ability to embed your videos on external websites\u2014especially your own\nA focus on business needs, not just the needs of independent content creators\nWhile those are the dealbreakers, I also considered other features, such as the option to customize your video player or add closed captioning, a big plus. They weren't necessary for inclusion, but at the end of the day, I was looking for a business video platform that offered the kind of complete package a business needs. Modern platforms that stay up-to-date with the latest developments are always going to be preferable to older platforms that don't adapt. \nObviously, AI has been one of the biggest trends over the past 18 months, and it has started to creep into some video hosting platforms. Sometimes, existing features like optimization are rebranded as AI, but you can also find platforms that use AI to automatically generate closed captions, video descriptions, and more. Where these features added to the overall experience of using an app, I've noted them, but they didn't really have a massive impact on the list. A well-thought-out app that enables you to host your business videos was what I was looking for\u2014AI features or not.\nBecause video is so popular online, I had to draw a couple of hard lines. I haven't included video platforms that primarily support live streaming or social media apps, such as TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, in this list. Yes, these apps allow you to upload and host videos, but that's an add-on feature and not the core function of the app. That's not to say you shouldn't upload your marketing videos to these sites\u2014just that they don't have the same flexibility as other options.  \nI also excluded software like Brightcove that offers more robust, advanced video capabilities (like video communications, digital content management, and virtual events) because those apps can be overwhelming if you're just looking to host and share a video. Similarly, apps like Dailymotion\u2014that are primarily for content publishers\u2014also didn't make the cut.\nFinally, I haven't included any bad apps. As ridiculous as that sounds, some of the apps I tested were just unpleasant to use, so even if they technically had all the features I was looking for, I didn't include them. \nI tested each app by uploading and customizing a video to get a feel for the general user experience, as well as checking out any headline features. After spending time with each app, I also researched it to make sure it had a good track record hosting videos\u2014this isn't the kind of service you want to suddenly stop working.\nThe best video hosting sites at a glance\nBest for\nStandout features\nPricing\nYouTube\nExisting viewership\nLarge existing audience and free hosting\nFree for uploading and hosting videos\nVimeo\nCollaboration on videos\nEffortless collaboration and AI features\nFree for Vimeo Basic; from $20/user/month\nWistia\nVideo marketing\nTurnstile email collector, nice marketing features\nFree for 10 videos and basic features; from $24/month\nSpotlightr\nQuizzing your audience\nInteractive quizzes and in-depth analytics\nFrom $9/month\nUscreen\nVideo monetization\nCreate a subscription service\nFrom $199/month plus $1.99/subscriber/month\nBest video platform for free video hosting and an existing viewership\nYouTube (Web, Android, iOS)\nYouTube pros:\nEveryone is already familiar with YouTube\nFree and fast to get started with\nYouTube cons:\nNot the most customizable or professional-looking option\nYouTube allows you to upload videos for free, and creators can even earn money for their content through ads, channel memberships, merch shelf, Super Chat, Super Thanks, Super Stickers, and YouTube Premium views. Thanks to its popularity and built-in audience\u2014it has well over 120 million active users per day\u2014YouTube is often the default choice for business owners to host their videos. And it helps that its videos are often given prime spots in Google search results.\nYouTube Studio is where you'll manage all your channel and video details. Log in with your Google account and launch a channel under your personal name or business name. Once you've customized your channel, you can start uploading videos. You can automatically add subtitles, an end screen to promote related content, or cards to highlight content during your video. \nIf you're more concerned with getting your videos in front of the right people than just embedding them on your website, YouTube is a great option. You have a built-in audience of millions of people already interested in video content. So if you optimize your videos for search or encourage fans to get notifications when you add a new video to your channel, you may be able to build a native audience. Of course, you still have the option to add the videos to your website with a simple embed code\u2014but every YouTube video embedded on an external website looks like a YouTube video.\nAlso, if you intend to monetize your YouTube videos using ads, you won't have control over exactly what companies get associated with your brand. Unless you take particular steps to block them, for example, a competitor could advertise on your video. You're also at the mercy of Google's content moderation policies and will have no access to customer support. For these reasons, while YouTube can be a great place to host certain videos you want an audience to discover\u2014and even be a reasonable default\u2014it may not be the right choice for all your video needs. Or, at least, not the exclusive choice. Many major brands share their videos on their social media, YouTube, and their own websites using different tools, depending on what audience they're trying to reach and what purpose the videos serve. So, even if you also use one of the other services on this list, don't write off YouTube as an additional option. \nYouTube also integrates with Zapier, helping you automate marketing and promotional activities for your videos across thousands of apps. Discover some popular ways to automate YouTube, or get started with one of these pre-made workflows.\nSend new YouTube videos in a channel to a Facebook Page\nTry it\nUpload new Dropbox files to YouTube as videos\nTry it\nSend new YouTube videos in a channel to Slack\nTry it\nYouTube pricing: Free for uploading and hosting videos.\nIf you're looking for a YouTube alternative, check out Streamable. It's similarly easy to use and offers mostly hassle-free video embedding.\nBest video hosting service for collaboration\nVimeo (Web, Android, iOS)\nVimeo pros:\nMore business-focused than YouTube\nGreat collaboration features\nVimeo cons:\nNo real built-in audience\nVimeo began as a video-sharing platform, similar to YouTube. And while the platform still allows users to post videos and follow their favorite creators, it also has business-focused features like team collaboration, analytics and marketing features, a (lightly) customizable embedded video player, and even an OTT platform that you can optionally use to monetize your content with subscriptions or sales.\nIf you work with other people, Vimeo's most impressive feature is the effortless collaboration it facilitates: it allows creators to invite clients, team members, freelancers, and other collaborators to preview their private projects. And it offers different permission levels for each reviewer or collaborator, which you can change depending on the project. They're able to leave time-stamped comments, so you can make any adjustments as necessary. It's almost like Google Docs for video.\nVimeo is also leaning hard into AI. You can use it to create a script that you can then read from a built-in teleprompter while recording a video. And then you can use another AI tool to automatically cut out any uhs and ums and generate a transcript. Of course, these features are more useful if you intend to use Vimeo to help create and edit your videos in addition to hosting them.\nIs Vimeo the right video hosting for your business? Maybe. Its collaboration and AI features certainly make it useful for creating and editing videos, and its customizable player means you can embed its videos on your website without a Vimeo logo, or even rely on the OTT options to monetize your videos. The lack of ads for videos uploaded by paid subscribers and a few other features certainly make it more business-friendly by default than YouTube\u2014though without the built-in audience. If you want a flexible, easy option that's a bit more professional than Google's platform, it's definitely worth a look.\nYou can automate your processes with Vimeo as well, using Zapier's Vimeo integration to automatically take actions in other apps whenever you upload a video to Vimeo. Here are some examples.\nSend new Slack messages for new videos on your Vimeo account\nTry it\nAdd new rows on Google Sheets for new videos you upload to Vimeo\nTry it\nPost your new Vimeo videos on WordPress\nTry it\nVimeo pricing: Free for Vimeo Basic; $20/user/month for the Starter plan that includes version history, review and approval features, and private team projects. AI features available on Standard plan from $33/user/month. Vimeo OTT costs from $1/subscriber/month.\nBest video hosting service for video marketing\nWistia (Web)\nWistia pros:\nGreat lead capture and other marketing features\nEasy to set up and use\nWistia cons:\nBest features only available on paid plans\nWistia is packed with marketing features that help businesses track a video's progress, collect leads, and get the best ROI on their content.\nOne of its flagship features is Wistia's Turnstile email collector, which helps you generate leads by getting people to enter their email address before they can play your video. You can add the form at any point in your video\u2014so you can get them engaged before hitting them with the marketing pitch\u2014and customize the text to suit your needs. Once a viewer enters their information, they're added to your email list using Wistia's email marketing integrations, including platforms such as Campaign Monitor, Mailchimp, and Constant Contact.\nIf you don't want to add a Turnstile to your videos, Wistia still offers powerful marketing features. You can use annotation links to guide viewers to a website of your choice. These links appear on the upper-right corner of your video, for as long as you like, without disrupting a viewer's experience. You can also add a call-to-action or link to another video or web page at the end of a video. And tying it all together is the Analytics page that lets you gauge the performance of each of your videos at a glance: how long your viewers stick around for, and if they fill in your form or click your link, is tracked here.\nWistia also automatically generates a transcript for your videos, and from that, you can create closed captions for more accessible videos. You can also upload your own audio descriptions, but Wistia can't automate them.\nIt's important to note that Wistia's marketing features are only available when you embed them in a webpage, marketing email, or the like. If you export your videos to social media, you'll lose any customizations, Turnstiles, or other marketing features.\nWistia's Zapier integration allows you to trigger actions in thousands of other apps whenever new videos are uploaded or users take certain actions on your videos. Or you can automatically create an embed code and send it to the app of your choice whenever you upload a new video. Here are a few examples for inspiration.\nUpload Wistia videos from new Dropbox files\nTry it\nShare new Wistia visitors via Gmail messages\nTry it\nAutomatically upload videos to Wistia from Google Drive\nTry it\nWistia pricing: Free for 10 videos and standard features, such as a fully customizable player and basic video analytics; from $24/month for the Plus plan that includes lead generation tools, 20 videos, and no Wistia branding.\nBest video hosting platform for quizzing your audience\nSpotlightr (Web)\nSpotlightr pros:\nQuiz feature is very clever and can be used to capture leads\nIn-depth analytics\nSpotlightr cons:\nRequires more engagement from viewers to participate in a quiz or follow a link\nIf you're looking for a deep dive into your videos' performance, including who views them, where, and for how long, Spotlightr (formerly vooPlayer) gives you all the data you need. The platform offers numerous reports based on viewer location, engagement, play rate, conversion, and completion.\nOne of the most impressive features is Spotlightr's quizzes, which let you overlay and stop videos with interactive questions that can collect marketing information, as well as assess how well anyone learning from your videos is doing. You can also create custom overlays that link to other videos, offer coupons, or otherwise engage your audience. Similarly, at the end of a video, you can automatically send viewers to a landing page or another video, or show an end card with anything you want.\nIf you want to do a bit more with your videos than just demonstrate your products, it's a great option, though obviously, convincing someone to give you their email address or use a coupon can be a larger challenge than getting them to play a video on YouTube. But if they do, Spotlightr integrates with Zapier, so you can also do things like send captured leads to a spreadsheet, CRM, or email marketing tool.\nSpotlightr price: From $9/month for the Spark plan that includes 25 videos, a brandable player, and hybrid hosting. Quizzes are available on the Polaris plan at $49/month.\nBest video hosting site for subscription videos\nUscreen (Web)\nUScreen pros:\nCreate your own video-on-demand subscription service\nOne of the best ways to monetize your videos online\nUScreen cons:\nVery expensive and not the most suitable tool for general video hosting\nUscreen is a little different from the other apps on this list. Instead of allowing you to host videos somewhere, so you can embed them on your website or share them on social media, it enables you to monetize your video content by selling it or even creating a Netflix-like premium subscription service. While not the best option for general video hosting, it's perfect if you have a small business\u2014like a yoga studio or gym, or some kind of craft shop\u2014and want to monetize instructional videos. It's kind of like Shopify, but specifically designed for video content.\nThis means getting set up with Uscreen takes a bit of time. Not only do you have to upload your videos, but you need to create a website (from one of the included themes), configure your subscription or payment plan, link it to a payment processor like Stripe, and do lots more before launch. It's a lot, but the interface is easy to use, there are great tutorials, and you get a one-to-one onboarding call as part of any plan. \nPerhaps the most interesting feature is that you can create your own iOS, Android, and TV apps using Uscreen\u2014though only on the $599/month Pro plan. It's not a feature that most businesses are likely to need, but if your cooking courses or whatever subscription you're selling takes off, the option is there. \nUscreen also integrates with Zapier, so you can automatically add new UScreen customers to your marketing automation software or add new eCommerce customers to Uscreen, among endless other options.\nLog new Uscreen customers in Google Sheets\nTry it\nAdd new Shopify customers to Uscreen\nTry it\nAdd new Uscreen users to a Mailchimp list\nTry it\nUscreen pricing: From $199/month plus $1.99/subscriber/month for the Growth plan, which includes a customizable website and 100 hours of video storage.\nMuvi is another solid OTT app that offers video hosting. The price can add up, but it's a solid alternative to Uscreen.\nOther ways to host your business videos\nWhile the best business video hosting services definitely have their place, there are alternative options out there if you don't need the extra features they bring. Here are some other options to consider:\nIf you use a site builder like Squarespace or Wix, or even a blogging platform like WordPress or Ghost, you can just upload videos directly to it. \nWhile I wouldn't recommend you exclusively share videos to TikTok, Facebook, or even X, it's still worth reposting most of your content there\u2014if only to reach a wider audience. \nIf you have a team of developers (or can code yourself), the big cloud hosting platforms like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all offer video hosting. \nThere are also a handful of other apps, like Muse.ai, Streamable, and Dacast, that almost made this list but fell short for a number of smaller reasons that might still suit your business needs.\nAnd if you really want to go rogue or just need to share things internally, you can host videos in Google Drive, Dropbox, or even on something like Notion.\nWhat are the best video hosting platforms for business?\nIf you're looking to earn money from your videos, opt for a video hosting service that supports ads or lets you set up a subscription plan. If promoting your business is your main goal, you might look for a service with robust marketing and analytics tools. The most important thing is that you're getting your videos in front of the people you want to see them.\nThis article was originally published in March 2019 by Farheen Gani and has also had contributions from Emily Esposito.

        "title": "Stable Diffusion vs. DALL\u00b7E 3: Which image generator is better? [2024]",
        "content": "Which AI image generator should you choose? I spent time tinkering with each one to help you make your pick.",
        "content1": "Stable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 3 are two of the best AI image generation models available right now\u2014and they work in much the same way. Both models were trained on millions or billions of text-image pairs. This allows them to comprehend concepts like dogs, deerstalker hats, and dark moody lighting, and it's how they can understand what a prompt like \"an impressionist oil painting of a Canadian man riding a moose through a forest of maple trees\" is actually asking them.\nAutomatically generate blog images\nLearn how\nIn addition to being AI models, Stable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 3 both have apps that are capable of taking a text prompt and generating a series of matching images.\nSo which of these apps should you use? Let's dive in.\nHow do Stable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 3 work?\nFor image generation, Stable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 3 both rely on a process called diffusion. The image generator starts with a random field of noise, and then edits it in a series of steps to match its interpretation of the prompt. By starting with a different set of random noise each time, they can create different results from the same prompt. It's kind of like looking up at a cloudy sky, finding a cloud that looks kind of like a dog, and then being able to snap your fingers to keep making it more and more dog-like.\nA dog-shaped cloud floating in a clear blue sky\u2014from top-left, going clockwise, at 10 steps, 20 steps, 40 steps, and 120 steps.\nEven though both models have similar technical underpinnings, there are plenty of differences between them. \nStability AI (the makers of Stable Diffusion) and OpenAI (the makers of DALL\u00b7E 3) have different philosophical approaches to how these kinds of AI tools should work. They were also trained on different data sets, with different design and implementation decisions made along the way. So although you can use both to do the same thing, they can give you totally different results.\nHere's the prompt I mentioned above from Stable Diffusion:\nAnd here it is from DALL\u00b7E 3:\nSomething else to keep in mind:\nDALL\u00b7E 3 is only available through ChatGPT, the Bing Image Creator, Microsoft Paint, and other services using its API.\nStable Diffusion is actually a number of open source models. You can access it through Stability AI's DreamStudio app (or, in a more basic form, through Clipdrop), but you can also download the latest version of Stable Diffusion, install it on your own computer, and even train it on your own data. (This is how many services like Lensa's AI avatars work.)\nI'll dig into what this all means a little later, but for ease of comparison, I'll mostly be comparing the models as they're accessed through their official web apps: ChatGPT for DALL\u00b7E 3 and DreamStudio for Stable Diffusion.\nStable Diffusion vs. DALL\u00b7E 3 at a glance\nStable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 3 are built using similar technologies, but they differ in a few important ways. Here's a short summary of things, but read on for the details. \nStable Diffusion\nDALL\u00b7E 3\nOfficial web app\nDreamStudio\nChatGPT\nQuality\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Exceptional AI-generated images\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Exceptional AI-generated images\nEase of use \n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Lots of options, but can get complicated\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Collaborate with a chatbot\nPower and control\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 You still have to write a prompt, but you get a lot of control over the generative process\n\u2b50 Very limited options beyond asking the chatbot to make changes\nBoth make great AI-generated images\nLet's get the big thing out of the way: both Stable Diffusion and DALL\u00b7E 3 are capable of producing incredible AI-generated images. I've had heaps of fun playing around with both models, and I've been shocked by how they've nailed certain prompts. I've also laughed quite hard at both their mess-ups. Really, neither model is objectively\u2014or even subjectively\u2014better than the other. At least not consistently. \nIf I was forced to highlight where the models can differ, I'd say that:\nBy default, Stable Diffusion tends toward more photorealistic images, though it can subtly mess up things like faces, while DALL\u00b7E 3 makes things that look more abstract or computer-generated.\nDALL\u00b7E 3 feels better \"aligned,\" so you may see less stereotypical results.\nDALL\u00b7E 3 can sometimes produce better results from shorter prompts than Stable Diffusion does.\nThough, again, the results you get really depend on what you ask for\u2014and how much prompt engineering you're prepared to do.\nStable Diffusion\nDALL\u00b7E 3\nDALL\u00b7E 3 is easier to use\nDALL\u00b7E 3 is incredibly simple to use. Open up ChatGPT, and so long as you're a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you can chat away and make requests.\nIf you aren't a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you can still check out DALL\u00b7E 2, which has more editing options, or try DALL\u00b7E 3 through Bing Chat or Microsoft Image Creator. But I'm focusing on using it through ChatGPT here\u2014it's the most consistent way with the most control.\nOut of the box, Stable Diffusion is a little less user-friendly. Although you can type a prompt and hit Dream, there are more options here that you can't help but wonder about.\nFor example: you can select a style (Enhance, Anime, Photographic, Digital Art, Comic Book, Fantasy Art, Analog Film, Neon Punk, Isometric, Low Poly, Origami, Line Art, Craft Clay, Cinematic, 3D Model, or Pixel Art). There are also two prompt boxes: one for regular prompts and another for negative prompts, the things you don't want to see in your images. You can even use an image as part of the prompt. And that's all before you consider the advanced options that allow you to set the prompt strength, the number of generation steps the model takes, what model is used, and even the seed it uses.\nOf course, installing and training your own Stable Diffusion instance is an entirely different story\u2014and will require a bit more technical knowledge.\nStable Diffusion is more powerful\nFor all its ease of use, DALL\u00b7E 3 doesn't give you a lot of options. You can generate images from a prompt, and\u2026that's kind of it. If you don't like the results, you can ask ChatGPT to try again, but all it does is tweak your  prompt and try again. Even the Bing tools that use DALL\u00b7E 3 don't give you many more options. The only ones of note are that Image Creator allows you to import your image directly into Microsoft Designer, and Paint allows you to generate images in the app, so you can edit them (or at least paint over the top).\nWhile these images look great, DALL\u00b7E 3 has re-run the prompt and completely changed the images.\nIt's worth noting that, at least for now, DALL\u00b7E 3 has fewer features than DALL\u00b7E 2 did. With DALL\u00b7E 2, you could inpaint (where you use AI to edit parts of an image) and outpaint (where you use AI to add to the boundaries of an image), while DALL\u00b7E 3 doesn't yet support any kind of AI image editing\u2014it just re-runs a new prompt if you ask for adjustments.\nStable Diffusion (in every iteration except Clipdrop) gives you more options and control. As I mentioned above, you can set the number of steps, the initial seed, and the prompt strength, and you can make a negative prompt\u2014all within the DreamStudio web app.\nFinally, if you want to build a generative AI that's custom-trained on specific data\u2014such as your own face, logos, or anything else\u2014you can do that far more readily with Stable Diffusion. This allows you to create an image generator that consistently produces a particular kind or style of image. The specifics of how you do this are far beyond the scope of this comparison, but the point is that this is something that Stable Diffusion is designed to do that isn't really possible with DALL\u00b7E 3\u2014at least not without diving deep into configuring your own custom GPT, and even then, your options are far more limited .\nPricing isn't apples to apples\nDALL\u00b7E 3's pricing is super simple: it costs $20/month as part of ChatGPT Plus, or it's available for free as part of different Microsoft tools, though some of them will watermark your images. As of now, there are no limits published on how many images you can generate each day or month with DALL\u00b7E 3, but presumably they exist to prevent people from creating images non-stop. \nStable Diffusion is free with watermarks on Clipdrop, but on DreamStudio, its pricing is a lot more complicated than DALL\u00b7E 3. (And that's before we even get into downloading Stable Diffusion and running it on your computer or accessing it through some other service that uses a custom-trained model.) \nIn that case, Stable Diffusion uses a credits system, but it's nowhere near as neat as one credit, one prompt. Because you have so many options, the price changes with the size, number of steps, and number of images you want to generate. Say you want to generate four 1024x1024 pixel images with the latest model using 50 steps. That would cost 1.01 credits. If you wanted to use just 30 steps, it would only cost 0.8 credits. (You can always see the cost before you press Dream.)\nYou get 25 free credits when you sign up for DreamStudio, which is enough for ~100 images (or ~25 text prompts) with the default settings. After that, it costs $10 for 1,000 credits. That's enough for more than 5,000 images or ~1,250 text prompts at the default settings.\nSo, depending on how many images you want to generate, whether you already pay for ChatGPT Plus, and how much you care about watermarks, the best service for you totally changes. DreamStudio offers a lot of bang for your buck and it has a free trial, but there are ways to check out both models for free.\nCommercial use is complicated for both\nIf you're planning to use Stable Diffusion or DALL\u00b7E 3 for commercial use, things get a bit complicated.\nCommercial use is currently allowed by both models (although not if you use DALL\u00b7E 3 through Microsoft), but the implications haven't been fully explored. In a ruling in February 2023, the U.S. Copyright Office decided that images created by Midjourney, another generative AI, can't be copyrighted. This means that anyone may be able to freely take any image you create and use it to do whatever they want\u2014though this hasn't really been tested.\nPurely from a license standpoint, Stable Diffusion has a slight edge. Its model has fewer guardrails\u2014and even less if you train one yourself\u2014so you can create more kinds of content. DALL\u00b7E 3 won't allow you to create a huge amount of content, including images of public figures.\nDALL\u00b7E 3 vs. Stable Diffusion: Which should you use?\nWhile DALL\u00b7E 3 is the biggest name in AI image generation, there's a case to be made for giving Stable Diffusion a go first: DreamStudio has a fully-featured free trial, it's generally cheaper overall, it's more powerful, and it has more permissive usage rights. If you go totally off the deep end, you can also use it to develop your own custom generative AI.\nBut DALL\u00b7E 3 is readily available through ChatGPT and Bing, and the $20 you pay for ChatGPT Plus also includes all the other features of ChatGPT Plus\u2014a tool I use at least a few times a week.\nEither way, the decision doesn't really come down to the quality of the generated output but rather the overall user experience and your actual needs. Both models can create awesome, hilarious, and downright bizarre images from the right prompt, so try both, and go with the one you like best.\nRelated reading:\nExamples of real businesses using DALL\u00b7E for visual content\nAI image generation examples for the workplace\nHow to use Leap AI to train your own AI image model\nCanva AI tools to improve your design workflow\nThe top AI art generators\nThis article was originally published in May 2023.

        "content1": "So you've set up your Shopify storefront, taken professional photos of all your products, listed your inventory, written copy, and created a promotional blog. All that's left is for people to actually pay for your wares. Now what?\nTake your store to the next level\nAutomate Shopify\nIf you're selling tins of candied nuts to my 73-year-old dad, you can take credit card information over the phone. But since this isn't 1987, you'll need a payment gateway to get people's digital cash into your digital hand.\nShopify has a built-in payment gateway, but if you want to use Stripe instead, here's how to set up a Shopify Stripe integration\u2014and what to do if the Stripe integration isn't available in your location.\nShopify Stripe integration at a glance:\nShopify has a native payment processor called Shopify Payments, which is powered by Stripe.\nShopify Payments isn't available in every country, but you can still integrate third-party payment processors like Stripe into your Shopify store.\nShopify doesn't enable Stripe integration for all locations, but you can always use Zapier to connect them.\nWhy integrate Shopify and Stripe?\nTechnically, many Shopify users get Stripe payment processing through Shopify's native payment gateway, Shopify Payments, which is powered by Stripe. This gives users the ability to accept credit card payments through their Shopify store without having to pay extra third-party transaction fees, and customers don't have to jump over to a second website to complete their payment since the processing happens right on the Shopify site.\nWith all that fee-free convenience, most users will want to stick with Shopify Payments\u2014but here's why that may not be the case for you:\nShopify Payments isn't available in your country.\nYou already accept payments via Stripe and want to maintain continuity.\nYou're having trouble setting up Shopify Payments or accepting payments through that gateway.\nYou automate Stripe and want to continue using your automated workflow.\nFor pricing, Stripe charges 2.9% plus $0.30 per online card transaction (depending on location), which is the same as Shopify's Basic plan. But keep in mind that Shopify charges an additional 2% processing fee (Basic plan) for all transactions made using third-party payment processors, including Stripe, so you're paying extra to go with Stripe.\nHow to add Stripe to Shopify: 4 steps\nHere's how to add Stripe to Shopify in just a few quick steps.\nStep 1: Access your Shopify account settings\nI'll assume you're reading this because you already have Shopify and Stripe accounts. (If not, we'll call that Step 0\u2014go ahead and create those first.)\nOnce you're sure Stripe is available to integrate with Shopify in your country, kick things off by logging in to your Shopify account, and head to the Settings menu.\nNote that to get through the rest of the steps, you'll need admin privileges and an active account with a paid plan.\nStep 2: Access the Payments module\nOnce you're in the settings, click the Payments tab on the left menu bar.\nIf this option is grayed out, it's likely because you don't have administrative access, you're using a free trial, or your account isn't current on payments for a premium tier. Check with the account holder to remedy these issues. When in doubt, you can contact Shopify customer support to troubleshoot.\nStep 3: Change your payment provider\nYou should now be in the Payments module. In the Additional payment methods box, you should see a button to Add payment method. You guessed it\u2014click that. (Again, if this button doesn't appear, contact an account administrator or Shopify customer support.)\nThis should bring up a field where you can search for your preferred provider by name\u2014in this case, Stripe. \nIf Stripe is available where you live, you should be able to pick it. But if Shopify Payments is available, Stripe may not show up or may appear as \"Unavailable in your country\" since Shopify seemingly prefers users deploy their native payment processor.\nStep 4: Connect to Stripe\nSelecting Stripe should trigger a login prompt. Enter your login credentials, hit Activate, and badda bing: Shopify Stripe integration. If Stripe gives you a \"No results found\" notice like the one above, it likely means you either live where Shopify Payments is available or somewhere Stripe is not.\nYou should be all set at this point to start taking Stripe payments on your Shopify site, but if any step in this process hasn't worked, try logging in to the Shopify help center to get to the bottom of it.\nIf the integration does go through successfully, you should run a test purchase just to make sure everything's shipshape.\nHow to DIY a Shopify Stripe integration if Stripe is unavailable\nSo that's how to integrate Stripe with Shopify. It's so easy you probably got all these steps from a Google featured snippet, but if you've reached this point in the article, here's a bonus tip.\nIntegrating Shopify and Stripe natively is an easy way to make Stripe your Shopify payment gateway. But if you want to integrate them in a more customizable way\u2014or connect both apps to thousands of other apps\u2014you can use Zapier's Shopify Stripe integration. \nWith Zapier, you can create Shopify customers for new Stripe subscriptions, update existing Shopify customers from new Stripe payments, and create Shopify orders from new Stripe payments. And that's just the tip of the automationberg. Here are a few more examples to get your wheels turning.\nCreate new Stripe products when new Shopify products are added\nTry it\nCreate Shopify orders for new Stripe subscriptions\nTry it\nUpdate Shopify customers when new Stripe checkout sessions are completed\nTry it\nUpdate Stripe customers with new Shopify paid orders\nTry it\nZapier is a no-code automation tool that lets you connect your apps into automated workflows, so that every person and every business can move forward at growth speed. Learn more about how it works.\nShopify Stripe integration FAQ\nDoes Shopify use Stripe?\nShopify uses Stripe to power its Shopify Payments offering, which is its native payment processor. Those who want to use Stripe to accept payments instead can add a third-party Stripe integration (a process outlined in this very article), but this will come with additional per-transaction Shopify fees. \nDoes Stripe integrate with Shopify?\nStripe connects to Shopify as a third-party integration in some locations. You can set this up by logging into your Shopify Admin panel, going to the settings, and changing your payment provider to Stripe. This may not be available, depending on your location.\nHow much does Stripe cost vs. Shopify?\nStripe and Shopify charge the same amount per transaction: 2.9%, plus $0.30. Shopify requires you to pay monthly subscription fees, but it does reduce per-transaction fees for plans above the Basic tier. And again, if you use Stripe with Shopify, you'll have an extra 2% added on. \nRelated reading:\nHow to sell on Shopify: A 5-step guide\nShopify marketing: Ideas to boost your eCommerce sales\nStripe vs. PayPal: Which payment processor is best?\nThe best invoicing software",

        "content1": "Where else can you do everything from discussing intricate Minecraft builds, recommending lawn care services in your area, and diving deep into obscure scientific theories\u2014but Reddit?\nThe popular social sharing site boasts more than 70 million daily unique views and 100 thousand active communities, and it's growing every day. Not only is Reddit an extremely popular platform for personal use, but it's quickly becoming a great way to market a brand.\nWhether you use Reddit for fun or business, keeping up with the platform on your own can be tough. Automated workflows (we call them Zaps) can help you save time and stay on top of your mentions without spending hours on Reddit every day. Below, we've gathered a few of the best ways to automate Reddit with Zapier.\nNew to Zapier? It's an automation tool that helps anyone connect apps and automate workflows\u2014without any complicated code. Sign up for free to use this app, and many others, with Zapier.\nTable of contents\nSend notifications from Reddit\nCreate Reddit posts from an RSS feed \nCross-post between social accounts\nConnect Reddit with Google Sheets\nTo get started with a Zap template\u2014what we call our pre-made workflows\u2014just click on the button. It only takes a few minutes to set up. You can read more about setting up Zaps here.\nSend notifications from Reddit\nSince more and more people are using Reddit to improve their search results, you'll want to stay on top of your or your brand's mentions. But logging into Reddit daily may not be practical. And if your brand is big enough, checking Reddit even once a day may not be enough to catch potentially viral conversations. \nWith automation, you can send notifications to your most-used communication tools whenever you're mentioned on Reddit. That way, you and your team can track conversations around your brand. (Or if you just want to update your friends about your popularity on Reddit, you can do that, too).\nThese integrations update your team by sending direct or channel messages in Slack or Discord whenever new Reddit content matching your parameters is detected. \nSend Discord channel messages for new hot posts in Reddit subreddits\nTry it\nSend Slack direct messages for new Reddit posts and comments matching your search\nTry it\nSend channel messages in Discord for new posts or comments matching searches in Reddit\nTry it\nGet Slack messages for posts in Reddit\nTry it\nSend Discord channel messages for new Reddit comments by user\nTry it\nOr, if you'd rather receive notifications the old-fashioned way, try one of these Zaps. Whenever a new post or comment matching your specifications appears on Reddit, you or your chosen recipients will receive an email automatically. \nSend emails through Gmail for new Reddit posts or comments matching a search term\nTry it\nGet Email Notifications of Reddit Mentions\nTry it\nCreate Reddit posts from an RSS feed \nAnother way to save time is to send content directly to Reddit from RSS feeds. For instance, maybe you have a vegan food blog, and part of your promotion strategy is to post links to new recipes in the r/PlantBasedDiet subreddit. Or maybe you just want to stay engaged with your community by sharing content from your favorite websites.\nWith these Zaps, new items in your chosen RSS feeds will be posted directly to your subreddit of choice. That way, you can keep your Reddit promotion strategy up to date without any extra work on your end. \nPost links in Reddit for new feed items\nTry it\nCreate Reddit link posts for new items in multiple rss feeds\nTry it\nCross-post between social accounts\nIf social media is more your speed than an RSS feed, you can automate that connection, too. Save yourself some time by creating new Reddit content from social posts (and vice versa).\nFrom social accounts to Reddit\nIf you have a robust social strategy, staying on top of content generation for multiple platforms can be a full-time job. You might post regularly on apps like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube\u2014and there's not much time left for Reddit. But why not cross-post from your other channels? After all, you spend all that effort creating new content for Instagram or YouTube, so let it pull double duty as Reddit content. \nCross-posting to Reddit can also boost views and engagement on those original platforms by notifying Redditors of content that might interest them on your blog or YouTube channel. \nNo matter your cross-posting strategy, these Zaps can help. With these automated workflows, a new link post will appear automatically on Reddit when you post new content to your Ghost or WordPress blog, YouTube channel, Facebook page, or Instagram account. You'll get more out of each social post without manually double-posting.\nPost new Reddit links for every new YouTube channel video\nTry it\nCreate Reddit link posts for new Instagram media\nTry it\nShare New Ghost Posts on Reddit\nTry it\nShare new WordPress posts on Reddit\nTry it\nCreate Reddit link posts from new Facebook Pages posts\nTry it\nShare new YouTube videos in a Reddit link post\nTry it\nFrom Reddit to social accounts\nOr maybe you're an avid Reddit user who wants to share trending content with your Facebook audience. By cross-posting from your subreddit to your Facebook page, you can expand the conversation and reach a wider community.\nThese Zaps automatically create a new photo or page post on your Facebook page whenever there's a new hot post in your chosen subreddit. It's much easier to build a following on Facebook when you regularly post fresh, interesting content\u2014and creating an automated posting pipeline from Reddit takes a lot of the work out of your hands.\nCreate Facebook Page photos for new hot posts in Reddit subreddits\nTry it\nSend hot Reddit posts to Facebook Pages\nTry it\nConnect Reddit with Google Sheets\nReddit moves fast, and new content is always coming\u2014which is great for users but a little overwhelming if you're looking for something specific. Maybe you're trying to track your brand's performance on Reddit or just want to compile a reliable archive of posts or comments matching your search terms. \nEither way, there's no better format than a spreadsheet for compiling and organizing information. But trying to keep a Google Sheet updated manually just isn't sustainable.\nThankfully, spreadsheets and automation were practically made for each other. These Zaps trigger anytime there's a new hot post in a specific subreddit or a new post (or comment) matching a specific search. Anytime a new post matching your chosen trigger appears, these workflows create a new, detailed spreadsheet row in Google Sheets for your later review.\nAdd new rows on Google Sheets for new posts or comments matching search terms on Reddit\nTry it\nCreate rows in Google Sheets for new hot posts in subReddit on Reddit\nTry it\nSave time and engage more by automating Reddit\nReddit is a great place for advice, interesting discussions, and getting lost down a rabbit hole for hours at a time. But given the sheer number of daily posts and discussions, it can be hard to track your mentions or keep up with the conversations you care about.\nThankfully, automation lets you connect Reddit to your other most-used platforms and apps. Easily send notifications, create posts from an RSS feed, cross-post from other social platforms, and track your Reddit data\u2014and more!\u2014with Zapier.\nAnd this is just the start of what you can do with Reddit and Zapier. What will you automate first?\nRelated reading:\nHow to use social media automation to promote your content\nHow to automatically write social media posts with AI and Zapier\nPopular workflows to better manage your brand's social media\nThis article was originally published in July 2021, written by Krystina Martinez.

        "content": "Offering an experience powered by the GPT and DALL-E models, courtesy of the close relationship with OpenAI, you'll see new magic buttons and AI chat boxes spread out in the Microsoft apps you use every day.",
        "content1": "I dream of a day when my computer can act as my assistant: summarize my top email threads, queue up music playlists for work, and run a quick Google search in the background while I write\u2014all through voice commands. That day may be closing in on us. After the boom of AI chatbots, AI has spread to other apps to offer a better, more integrated experience.\nMicrosoft Copilot isn't that yet\u2014but it's a step in the right direction. Offering an experience powered by the GPT and DALL\u00b7E models, courtesy of Microsoft's close relationship with OpenAI, you'll now see new magic buttons and AI chat boxes spread throughout the Microsoft apps you use every day.\nWhat is Microsoft Copilot?\nCopilot is a set of new features that combine large language models (LLMs) with existing Microsoft products:\nWindows 11\nBing Search's AI Chat\nMicrosoft Edge\nMicrosoft 365 apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams)\nCopilot's AI features include generative AI (text and images) and text and data analysis, among other things. The objective is to save time as you search, write, and ideate your way to get your job done.\nPairing AI with automation will change how you work\nLearn more\nThe features are spread out across the apps you use every day. When you ask Bing a question, start writing with AI in Word, or get into forecasting in Excel, a request flies out to the Microsoft Azure infrastructure. The AI models there compute the appropriate response and send it back to the app you're using. This means that you'll need an internet connection to access Copilot, as most personal computers aren't powerful enough for LLM-level work.\nI tested these new features myself by signing up for the early-release channels. As a long-time fan of Linux, I confess I'm excited by the prospect of using an AI-powered computer system. \nHow to use Microsoft Copilot in Windows 11\nStill in preview, Copilot for Windows 11 brings a chat experience into the operating system and a range of AI-powered features to Clipchamp, Photos, the Snipping Tool, and Paint.\nIf your system is up to date and you were part of the release wave, you'll find the Copilot icon in your taskbar. Alternatively, press the Windows key + C to check whether you have it installed.\nThe Copilot chat in Windows 11 shows promise, but there's still a lot of ground to cover. Once you open it, it sits as a sidebar to the entire window, like when using a browser but at a system level. It looks and works like Bing Chat: you can ask it the same questions, run internet searches, and ask it to generate images.\nThe Copilot sidebar in a clear Windows 11 desktop, ready to answer all your questions.\nIt can't control your system. This cuts both ways: having cutting-edge AI technology running your computer can be dangerous; but it would be awesome to type what you want to do in Windows and have the chatbot do everything for you.\nI asked it to open the Spotify app and play one of my playlists as a test. The best Copilot could do was offer a button in the chat that opens the app, but it didn't start playing anything.\nThis is still pretty good: the AI figured out my intent and offered a command to follow through. If this keeps evolving, here are a few possibilities that I'm hoping will become true:\nTroubleshoot issues with Windows by running an AI agent that finds solutions in Microsoft's knowledge base, creates a unique action plan, and executes the entire repair process while providing updates.\nRun a chain of actions involving multiple apps: based on a Notepad file, send that text to Word and expand it, generate images in the Microsoft cloud, and add them to the file.\nSearch for answers about a topic online and store it in multiple Word files, organized in a folder inside your computer.\nThis becomes even more interesting when you use your voice to talk to Copilot. The Windows dictation feature is excellent, sending what you're saying directly over to the AI. It replies back in voice, making it feel like you're having a conversation with your computer. Now imagine doing all I've described above just by talking: you won't have to tab out to other apps to record a short note, do a quick fact check, or send a brief email\u2014all this without leaving the task at hand.\nMoving on from the chat experience, AI landed in Clipchamp too. The Microsoft video editing app offers a simple user experience to polish your content, and now you can start a new project with AI Auto Compose. Upload your source video, choose a style, and select a background song. You'll get a video ready with transitions, jump cuts, and colorful backgrounds right out of the gate.\nIf you need a voiceover but aren't up to recording it yourself, there's a text-to-speech feature available, offering a range of controls for how the voice sounds. The result is decent, a good option if you're tight on time to source it elsewhere.\nIf you grew up in the '90s, I'm sure you remember Paint. It's making a comeback with the Cocreator feature, an AI image generation tool: start with your prompt, pick a style from the dropdown, and the result is pasted into the canvas, ready for editing. It can also blur the background of images, a feature that it shares with Photos.\nPaint makes a comeback with AI-generated images and background blur.\nFinally, if you take lots of screenshots, consider taking the improved Snipping Tool for a spin. It can now extract text from images and quickly detect and redact sensitive information such as email addresses and phone numbers. As someone who takes dozens of screenshots every week, not having to plug each one into an image editing app makes me very happy.\nThe Snipping Tool has new AI-powered possibilities that may save you from having to open the image in another app for quick edits.\nHow to use Microsoft Copilot in Bing Search's AI Chat and Microsoft Edge\nNext up, Bing Chat and Microsoft Edge. I've grouped these since the best way to access Bing Chat is via Microsoft's native browser\u2014and Edge doesn't have much else in terms of AI.\nA view of Copilot when accessed from the Microsoft Edge browser\nAfter the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft was quick to integrate AI into Bing Search, a chat experience for searching the internet and generating natural language responses based on the results. Its most exciting update is the integration with DALL\u00b7E 3, OpenAI's recent image generation model. \nGenerating images with Bing AI Chat in the Microsoft Edge browser.\nStart by stating that you want to generate an image, and type in the prompt. Four results will appear. While Bing suggests that you can regenerate parts of the image by adding additional prompts, this doesn't always work as expected. Keep trying to find what you're looking for.\nWhile you can access Bing's AI Chat in any browser, it has a special integration in Microsoft Edge. It's easier to access with its dedicated sidebar, offering a cute disclaimer in the footer: \"Copilot is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible.\" Indeed. \nBut the surprises don't end here. Take a closer look at the top of the sidebar, and click on the Compose tab.\nThe Compose tab generates content that you can paste easily into any input field on any website.\nHere, you can use a prompt to write a quick email, brainstorm ideas, or draft a blog post. There are extra controls for zeroing in on what you want:\nTone, anywhere from professional to funny\nFormat (paragraph, email, ideas, or a blog post)\nLength (it's a bit biased for longer responses)\nOnce you get your output, you can paste the response in any website you have open: just click the Add to site button. This is a useful shortcut to paste AI-generated text in a new Gmail email, a new WordPress post, or any input field anywhere on the web.\nHow to use Microsoft Copilot in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint\nWhat if you could create, expand, and improve your documents with an AI chat experience? This is the question that Copilot for Microsoft 365 sets out to answer. Instead of opening ChatGPT or Bing in a separate tab, you'll be able to access generative AI and data analysis directly within Microsoft's productivity suite.\nIn Word, you can get a first draft going with just a prompt. Use it to flesh out an idea or as a guideline for your own work, pruning and expanding with the AI writing tools: you can shorten or rewrite parts of your document and ask for AI feedback on sections you wrote yourself. It's like having dozens of products launched this year rolled into a single document-focused AI experience.\nExcel already offers data analysis, but it's greatly improved by Copilot. Using a chat window, you can ask questions about the data in your worksheets, explore \"what if\" scenarios, and create graphs using plain English.\nPowerPoint gets extra tools for its arsenal. For example, you can ask to create a new presentation based on one of your Word documents. PowerPoint will make it happen, lining up slides ready with text and images. You can add extra slides, make the presentation more visual, or add animation via the chat window. Don't know what to say on each slide? That's ok: there are AI-generated speaker notes to help you remember the key insights.\nOnly a few people use all the tools and commands in these apps, especially because it's time-consuming to learn them. But with prompts, AI can find the best way to create what you need, using the most appropriate tool for the job.\nMicrosoft planned to release these AI features in mid-November 2023 for the general crowd, but that got pushed back indefinitely\u2014so I haven't been able to test them yet. The above is a roundup of product videos and feature documents of Copilot for Microsoft 365. I'm excited to sit down to test them, so I'll come back and update this section as soon as I've got real experience to share.\nHow to use Microsoft Copilot in Outlook and Teams\nThe upgrades extend to Outlook and Teams, too. Communication is key, but the sheer amount is overwhelming and can drive you away from important tasks. Copilot features here focus on reducing time spent, while still extracting the important insights and following up fast with everyone involved. \nOutlook reorders your emails based on priority, a feature called Catch up with Copilot. It offers a set of topics present in your messages. When you click to start catching up, you'll be taken through the top threads, so you can reply quickly.\nThe conversation is long and full of angles, so why go through the entire novel when you can get a summary? Copilot can summarize entire email threads. And now that you have all the core information present in your mind, you can use generative AI to draft a response. For business users with Microsoft data services enabled, these responses can even retrieve file links, helping you provide everything your team needs to move forward.\nTeams has nearly everything that AI meeting assistant apps already offer. It transcribes meetings and has a Copilot button to summarize what's been said so far\u2014and even who said what. You can ask questions as to what the group is feeling about the topics at hand, but the participants need to be talking in-depth for this to have real value.\nCan't make it to a meeting? Click to follow it instead. Once it's done, you'll get a lot of data:\nThe meeting's transcript\nShared files\nA breakdown of topics and keywords\nA summary, notes, and tasks\nTo top it off, this meeting recap also has a chat window, so you can ask further questions to the data and get AI-generated insights based on the transcript.\nMicrosoft 365 Chat also deserves a mention here. It leans on the enterprise side for now and it's closely associated with Teams, but I hope it'll become available for everyone at some point. It acts as an AI-powered search engine for all your data in your Microsoft account, especially OneDrive (and Microsoft Graph if you have it set up). You can use it to ask questions about all your files and data, understand the differences between each of them, and analyze their content.\nCopilot everywhere\nThese are just the top places where you'll find Copilot. Enterprise users get a range of interesting features, letting them train AI on their company data and use it to assist employees in communication, generating content and finding more angles to look at information. These span more advanced apps such as Power Apps (create AI-powered apps), Power BI (analyze big data trends), and Business Chat (a tool to ask questions about your business data and get grounded, accurate answers).\nHow to access Microsoft Copilot\nRight now, you can access these Copilot features immediately:\nBing Chat by visiting the website and starting a new chat\nCopilot for Microsoft Edge\nCopilot for Windows 11 (make sure your system is updated to access it)\nAt the time of writing, Copilot for Microsoft 365 apps is still on the way. It was originally expected to drop in the middle of November 2023, but the timeline was pushed back without a new estimate.\nAI power everywhere\nAI features are spreading across software like a web, connecting models to buttons and commands, offering you endless possibilities to complete each task\u2014and it's up to you to choose and tweak the best ones.\nWhile most of these are still in preview mode, Microsoft Copilot is improving quickly, so be sure to check it out from time to time if you're not a full convert\u2014I definitely will.\nRelated reading:\nThe best AI productivity tools\nThe top AI art generators\nHow to create a custom AI chatbot with Zapier Interfaces",

        "content": "ClickFunnels and Leadpages are popular landing page builders, but they're very different tools. Here's how they compare across features, pricing, and usability.",
        "content1": "I regularly use landing pages to promote affiliate offers, so I've come across Leadpages a few times in the past. But I only recently discovered that ClickFunnels has a solid landing page builder too. \nConnect your landing page to your other apps\nFollow up fast\nTo be clear, Leadpages and ClickFunnels are different types of apps. Leadpages is dedicated landing page software, while ClickFunnels is more of an all-in-one tool for building sales systems\u2014including landing pages.\nI spent time testing their features to better understand each one's strengths and weaknesses and how they stack up. Here's the breakdown.\nBoth are easy-to-use landing page builders (but Leadpages is more intuitive)\nLeadpages has a more robust landing page builder\nClickFunnels has more features for conversion\nLeadpages is more affordable for small businesses\nLeadpages has more native integrations, but both connect with Zapier\nLeadpages vs. ClickFunnels at a glance\nLeadpages and ClickFunnels both have powerful tools to help you build and promote high-converting landing pages. But they're geared toward different audiences, which explains their feature sets and pricing. \nLeadpages is built for people looking for a simple way to collect leads. It combines simplicity with straightforward conversion tools and instantly tells you whether your landing page will produce the desired results.\nClickFunnels, on the other hand, is for more established businesses looking for an extensive sales solution. It'll give you fully automated funnels with landing pages, email marketing, and everything you need to run your business.\nThat said, there's a lot of overlapping functionality, so I dove in to see how they compare. Here's the quick version of ClickFunnels vs. Leadpages, but keep reading for more details about each app and my experience using them. Or you can skip ahead for my summary of which landing page builder will be best for you.\nLeadPages\nClickFunnels\nEase of use\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Very intuitive platform with clear labels for every feature\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 A little less intuitive due to extensive options, but clean and easy enough to figure out\nTemplates\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Over 250 professionally designed templates with a very modern look and simple sorting system\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 100+ good-looking templates, but uses a slightly confusing sorting system\nSales and conversions\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Built-in conversion guidance as you build your page\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Fully automated sales system plus built-in email marketing for lead nurture\nIntegrations\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Integrates with lots of third-party apps, including Zapier\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Integrates with lots of third-party apps, including Zapier\nPricing\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 More affordable for small businesses\nStandard: $49/month\nPro: $99/Month\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 More expensive but gives you more features for marketing and sales\nBasic: $147/month\nPro: $197/month\nFunnel Hacker: $297/month \nBoth landing page apps are easy to use (but Leadpages is more intuitive)\nLeadpages and ClickFunnels have nearly identical interfaces: both have a left navigation pane full of tools and features, with a summary of all your activities on the right. Here's a look (Leadpages on the left, ClickFunnels on the right.)\nBut even though they look similar, I find Leadpages a lot more intuitive.\nLet's start with the template system. Inside Leadpages, finding the template you need is straightforward. Navigate to the landing page section in the sidebar, and select Create new landing page to view a vast selection of templates for any business. The sorting system is equally simple: by popularity, conversion, and newest. You can also filter by page type, industry, style, or color. There's no need to sift through any page; everything is well-labeled for even the most inexperienced landing page builder. You'll instinctively know what to do.\nIn ClickFunnels, on the other hand, the process is less intuitive. For starters, there's no landing page option anywhere in the app. To find a template, you need to first locate Pages from the Sites tab on your dashboard, then select Standalone pages and New page. On the next screen, you'll see a collection of templates, but they're sorted by categories like sales, order, upsell/downsell, and more.\nThe difference is that these categorizations are based on funnel types instead of the page types approach that Leadpages uses. It's not a bad way of doing it, but it seems to cater more to people who are already conversant with sales funnels and know exactly what they're looking for. \nClickFunnels does provide loads of training videos to walk you through the funnel system and how to use the platform, but if you're looking to jump right into building a landing page, Leadpages is probably your best bet.\nLeadpages has a more robust landing page builder\nOnce you find the templates you need and are ready to start customizing, you'll find an interactive drag-and-drop builder in both platforms. They allow you to get creative and customize your page with content sections, widgets, pop-ups, and other elements. Both tools offer advanced styling options for everything, and you can see changes as you make them in the WYSIWYG editor. \nBut Leadpages adds some extra features in its builder, making it a bit more robust. For example, Leadpages includes \"Leadmeter,\" a conversion assistant that analyzes your page and predicts its performance before you publish. It'll spot issues in your CTA, copy, layout, and opt-in forms, and then offer customized suggestions for improving them. This feedback can make a huge difference, especially if you're using their basic plan, which doesn't include A/B testing.\nLeadpages' page builder also has an AI engine to help customize your page. If you can't find an ideal image for your landing page, you can quickly describe what you're looking for, and the image generator will create something decent in seconds.\nThe same goes with the writing assistant. It can write your entire landing page copy or rewrite and expand existing headlines, paragraphs, and CTAs to make them more compelling. It's nothing you can't get from existing AI writing tools and AI image generators, but it's built right into the app. And, as you customize your landing page, Leadpages allows you to optimize it for search engines and social media. You can add keywords, a title, and a description right there in the builder.\nIn ClickFunnels, you get an AI writer to assist with generating copy as you build out your page. But there's no image generator or conversion assistant to provide feedback on your copy and design or predict its performance. While you can optimize for search engines in ClickFunnels, it doesn't happen inside the builder\u2014you have to take several turns to locate the SEO functionality.\nClickFunnels has more features for conversion\nLeadpages markets itself as a conversion-optimized landing page builder. And it certainly does a solid job with its Leadmeter, alert bar, and exit intent pop-ups. But the conversion optimization features in ClickFunnels are playing a different sport altogether.\nFirst, there's email marketing. ClickFunnels has built-in email marketing functionality. So, if you're running a lead generation campaign, you can connect your email list to the landing page and automatically tag/segment visitors who complete your form. Then you can nurture those leads using a dripped email series\u2014without integrating any third-party tools.\nWhen you're ready to sell to your leads, ClickFunnels allows you to set up a series of automated pages\u2014called sales funnels\u2014specifically designed to draw leads closer and closer, until they become customers. \nHere's what I mean. When promoting a product, you could have multiple pages with order bumps, one-click upsells, and downsells, or other types of limited-time offers to enhance the value of your product and encourage subscribers to make a purchase. From there, you could have a thank-you or order confirmation page with more special offers still promoting the original offer.\nAnd based on the action a visitor takes, you could target them again with automated email sequences, follow-up SMS messages, or more landing pages to increase your chances of securing a sale. ClickFunnels provides fully designed templates for this process to allow you to visualize the steps a customer takes from landing on your page down to purchasing. It's very streamlined and optimized to convert.\nWith Leadpages, email marketing is nonexistent, so after generating leads, you have to connect a separate email marketing service to nurture them. If you have an email marketing app you love, that's not necessarily a bad thing\u2014just a different way of handling the process. And while technically, you can create a funnel on Leadpages, you'll have to build every page individually and then connect them manually using the form and link settings in templates.\nOne last feature worth mentioning in this section is A/B testing, which is critical for improving conversion rates. Both tools allow you to run unlimited split tests to check the effectiveness of your landing page, but Leadpages reserves this feature for users on its Pro plan, while ClickFunnels offers it on all plans.\nLeadpages is more affordable for small businesses \nClickFunnels and Leadpages both offer a 14-day free trial. But once that test drive is over and it's time to pull out your wallet, the two tools are worlds apart. \nLeadpages has two price tiers: Standard at $49/month and Pro at $99/month. Both plans include unlimited leads, traffic, and landing page publishing. But you can't access A/B testing or connect to more than one custom domain on the Standard plan. The Pro plan connects to three custom domains and unlocks A/B testing plus free eCommerce transactions.\nClickFunnels is more expensive, with its Basic plan costing $147/month. But that price comes with everything Leadpages offers, including automated sales systems, CRM features, and email marketing that you'd otherwise purchase separately.\nLeadpages is the obvious winner in price, but the difference in their feature sets is also clear. So, while Leadpages is more affordable for small businesses simply looking for a landing page builder, ClickFunnels could be cost-effective for experienced marketers who need a more sophisticated solution and want to avoid juggling several apps.\nLeadpages has more native integrations, but both connect with Zapier\nBoth platforms allow you to connect to the other apps you use in your business. Leadpages leads with 90+ native integrations to major CRMs, email service providers, and other business-focused app categories. But both tools integrate with Zapier, so you can connect ClickFunnels and Leadpages to thousands of other apps. That way, you can do things like automatically send emails and SMS messages to anyone who fills out a form or create new contacts when someone registers for an event. \nHere are some pre-made templates for inspiration, but Leadpages and ClickFunnels work across your entire tech stack.\nAdd new Facebook Lead Ads leads to ClickFunnels Classic lists\nTry it\nCreate contact profiles in ClickFunnels from new Typeform entries\nTry it\nAdd new Leadpages leads as Flodesk subscribers\nTry it\nLog new Leadpages submissions on Google Sheets\nTry it\nZapier is a no-code automation tool that lets you connect your apps into automated workflows, so that every person and every business can move forward at growth speed. Learn more about how it works.\nLeadpages vs. ClickFunnels: Which should you choose?\nBoth Leadpages and ClickFunnels will help you build effective landing pages, but they serve different audiences. \nChoose Leadpages if all you need is a landing page for lead generation, you have minimal marketing and sales experience, or you value simplicity in your tools. It'll help you create a professional landing page in minutes, easily track your performance, and reach your marketing goal.\nChoose ClickFunnels if you need an entire selling system, you want to nurture leads without using a third-party email marketing tool, or you plan to scale your business with gated or membership-only content and don't want the hassle of juggling several tools.\nRelated reading:\nPopular ways to automate ClickFunnels with Zapier\nConvertKit vs. ClickFunnels: Which should you use?\nLanding page ideas to help inspire your campaigns",
