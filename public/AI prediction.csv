What MMLU benchmark score will Google DeepMind's Gemini model have on release?,"This question will resolve as the highest MMLU (5-shot) score of any publicly available version of Google DeepMind's Gemini model at release. If Google doesn't provide the MMLU score for the Gemini model, this question will be resolved as the first MMLU score stated by a reliable source, as approved by Metaculus Admins. If Gemini is not released before 2025, then this question resolves as ambiguous."
"When will the first general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly announced?","We will thus define ""an AI system"" as a single unified software system that can satisfy the following criteria, all completable by at least some humans.
Able to reliably pass a 2-hour, adversarial Turing test during which the participants can send text, images, and audio files (as is done in ordinary text messaging applications) during the course of their conversation. An 'adversarial' Turing test is one in which the human judges are instructed to ask interesting and difficult questions, designed to advantage human participants, and to successfully unmask the computer as an impostor. A single demonstration of an AI passing such a Turing test, or one that is sufficiently similar, will be sufficient for this condition, so long as the test is well-designed to the estimation of Metaculus Admins."
Will at least 3 months of third party safety evaluations be conducted on Gemini before its deployment?,"This question will resolve positively Google DeepMind issues a statement on their blog, in an official paper, or in a media statement, on or before the release of their Gemini model, mentioning that they have given one or more third parties access to Gemini for the purpose of conducting safety evaluations and risk assessments for at least 3 months."
"Will an LLM by Apple be ranked in the top-5 on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard on May 31, 2024?","This question will resolve based on the ranking of language model chatbots on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard hosted on the Hugging Face website at Chatbot Arena Leaderboard. If an LLM developed by Apple or a subsidiary of Apple is listed among the top-5 positions on May 31, 2024, the question will resolve as 'Yes'. If no such LLM by Apple or a subsidiary of Apple appears in the top-5, or if the leaderboard is not updated or accessible by the resolution date, the question will resolve as 'No'."
"How many OpenAI or Anthropic models will be released between December 1, 2023 and May 31, 2024?","The question will resolve based on the number of new models released by OpenAI and Anthropic from December 1, 2023, to May 31, 2024. The count will be determined by checking OpenAI's official model documentation page and Anthropic's product page for new model listings. If the pages are not updated or the information is not available, credible secondary sources or direct announcements from the companies will be used to ascertain the number of new releases. If no verifiable information is found by the specified date, the question will resolve as ambiguous."
When will AI achieve competency on multi-choice questions across diverse fields of expertise?,"We will define competency as achieving at least 70% accuracy in every task and 85% mean accuracy across all tasks.
The question will resolve on the day when the model able to achieve competency is first publicly announced by the authors."
Will an AI model be developed before 2030 that can accurately predict local weather patterns up to 6 months in advance?,"This question will be considered resolved as Yes if, by December 31, 2029, a peer-reviewed study or an official announcement from a recognized meteorological organization confirms the development of an AI model that:
Predicts local weather patterns (e.g., temperature, precipitation) with a lead time of at least 6 months."
"When will the first weakly general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly announced?","For these purposes we will thus define ""AI system"" as a single unified software system that can satisfy the following criteria, all easily completable by a typical college-educated human.
Able to reliably pass a Turing test of the type that would win the Loebner Silver Prize.
Able to score 90% or more on a robust version of the Winograd Schema Challenge, e.g. the or comparable data set for which human performance is at 90+%"
"Will a politician claim they lost a major election due to a ""deepfake"" image, video, or audio recording in a G20 country before 2025?","This question resolves as YES if, by Dec 31, 2024, a politician in an election with >3M votes cast in a G20 country claims that they lost an election due to a deepfake video, image, or audio recording of them.
Fine Print"
