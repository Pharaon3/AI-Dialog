[{"title": "What Are Webhooks and Why Would You Use Them?", "content": "It\u2019s a critical resource for enterprises that need real time updates to be made across multiple applications. \nA streamlined tool for retailers aiming to deliver a seamless experience from the moment customers click \u2018checkout\u2019 to the moment their order arrives. \nAnd a must for influencers to instantly upload reels to Instagram the second they publish on TikTok. \nSo exactly what are webhooks? They\u2019re an easy-to-configure resource that enhances communication between the applications you use every day. Read on to learn how webhooks work and the ways you can benefit from webhook technology, in this article we will talk about the following:\nWhat are webhooks and how webhooks work\nDifferences between webhooks and API calls\nApps that support webhooks\nHow to set up webhooks\nLearning resources to create your first webhook\nHow to test webhooks\nFAQs about webhooks for new users\nWhat are webhooks and how do they work? \nWhat is a webhook? \nWebhooks are one app\u2019s method of providing another app with real-time information about an online event. In simple terms, a webhook is a technology that sends information when triggered by an event.\nA radar system is a great analogy for anyone learning how webhooks work: the radar system (webhook) is designed to pick up specific aircraft signals (event-specific data). When a signal is detected, the radar system immediately notifies a radar operator (the user).\nDoes your team rely on Discord? Then check out Make\u2019s Easy Guide to Discord Webhooks.\nThe event-specific data could be virtually anything: a user making edits on a shared document or a customer submitting a form on a website are simple examples. \nWebhook technology works when user-defined HTTP callbacks push data about an event to a URL configured to the webhook. Though similar, they\u2019re different from regular callbacks which typically communicate through a single app or platform. There\u2019s also a big difference between webhooks and APIs.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between APIs and webhooks?\nAPIs are exceptionally useful and understandably growing in popularity. At first glance, a webhook may seem like an alternative to an API call, but in reality, their functioning principles are different.\nAn API operates by polling data, which means it checks for new data and retrieves it only when it identifies the new data. \nWebhooks are triggered by an event, not simply the presence of new information. When an event happens, the webhook sends the corresponding data payload in real-time to the targeted URL. \nOne of the most important differences between webhooks and APIs is in the data delivery\u2019s timeliness. APIs can be scheduled; webhooks cannot. APIs can be scheduled in short time intervals, but webhooks will always be instantaneous. \nTake Make\u2019s scheduling function, for example. Let\u2019s imagine that you\u2019re managing your company\u2019s social media feed and want to monitor comments on a specific Facebook account you follow:\nFirst, use Make\u2019s \u201cWatch Comments\u201d module in a scenario. The \u201cWatch Comments\u201d module is effectively the Make API call to the Facebook API.\nThen, set a timing interval. You can set the interval however short or long you prefer, for example every five minutes.\nNext, the Make API call to the Facebook API will check for new tweets. The module monitors the account you\u2019re following throughout the scenario, looking for new comments every five minutes.\nFinally, if a new comment was posted within those five minutes, the API will identify them and show them to you. The API will pull all of the data you wish to see, in this case new comments, and only that data from the most recent time interval. How are webhooks different? \nWebhooks cannot be scheduled, so you wouldn\u2019t get the latest comments every five minutes. Instead, webhooks are built to deliver the data you\u2019re looking for the moment it\u2019s populated. If you established a webhook for comments from that account, you\u2019d see them in real time.\nWhy use a webhook: Examples and use cases \nThink of webhooks as another building block for your digital infrastructure. They enable you to execute multiple commands and constantly receive the most up-to-date information without requiring a heavy technical demand.\nBasically, they streamline information delivery and allow you to instantly act on that information.\nThink about how critical it is to follow up with prospective customers the moment they send an enquiry through a web form on your contact page. A webhook can connect that form to a Slack channel that collects these customer requests and makes them available to your sales team immediately. \nYou can also configure webhooks with other apps to identify a host of other online events, allowing you to:\nAutomatically populate spreadsheets with incoming data. \nSend notifications to different people about an event. \nCreate document templates with dynamic data.\nAdd new records to CRMs. \n(Un)subscribe people from your newsletter. \nCreate tasks on project management tools.\nFor example, some of our clients use Make modules to create a contract template from data received through a webhook attached to a web form.\nFirst, they connect two Make modules, such as our webhook module and our \u201cCreate a document from a template\u201d Google Docs module. Then, each time a form is received, a contract template is automatically created with the data from the web form. \nBut webhook success in your enterprise lies in the answer to two important questions: Do the apps you use support webhooks? \nAnd, if so, what can you do with the information you get from webhooks?\nWhich popular apps support webhooks?\nThe good news: virtually every app allows incoming data from webhooks, including:\nInstant messaging apps like Slack (through the \u201cEvents\u201d API)\nWeb forms like Typeform, Google Forms, JotForm, and Gravity Forms\nCRM platforms like HubSpot and Pipedrive\nChatbot builders like ManyChat and Chatfuel\nSocial media platforms like Facebook and Twitter\nCode repositories like GitHub\nProject management tools like ClickUp, Trello, and Jira\nAnd many others, including Make.\nThe challenge: not all apps allow the posting of data through webhooks, which is why it\u2019s important to understand how webhooks work but also how to use webhook integration in a way that amplifies your operations. \nHow to set up webhooks\nSetting up webhooks with Make is very user-friendly, even if it\u2019s your first time using webhook technology. You can typically create app-specific webhooks through the app itself. To create custom webhooks, you can insert a Make custom webhook module into a scenario, set up the webhook data structure, and begin scheduling webhook processing to test things out.\nHow to test webhooks\nIneffective webhooks don\u2019t cater to you or your prospects, which is why it\u2019s important to know how to test webhooks before relying on them. We suggest first creating a webhook and integrating it with the apps that you receive the most user engagement from. \nFor example, if many of your potential clients reach out to you via a webform, you should create and test those webhooks first. Don\u2019t wait for a customer to use it; execute the function yourself and create a webhook call by having an employee fill out the webform.\nWhen you add a module into a Make scenario, our platform automatically executes the scenario when webhook data is received. If you would rather process groups of data at once instead of dealing with every packet of data as soon as it\u2019s received, you can use Make to schedule webhook processing times. For instance, you could edit the scenario settings to store all incoming webhook data in a queue then only process and deliver it at a specifically scheduled time.\nWebhooks learning resources\nThe next thing you should read when learning about webhook technology is \u201cWeb hooks to revolutionize the web\u201d written by software engineer and Glider Labs co-founder, Jeff Lindsay. This article, written in 2007 and available on the Internet Archive, will help you build a foundation for webhook meaning and how webhook technology could be leveraged.\nOnce you get familiar with how webhooks work, you should then learn how to create webhooks in the apps that are keystones of your day-to-day operations. Most app developer docs will state if they support webhooks and how to set up a webhook or \u201coutgoing webhook\u201d. Take a look at Typeform\u2019s developer docs as an example. \nWhen you\u2019re ready to learn how to set up webhook integrations, Make has a dedicated help docs page that explains how to create webhook integrations through our platform. We provide step-by-step instructions on how to create and configure custom webhooks, work with different data formats, and process incoming webhook data. \nWe also have a number of pre-packed templates that feature webhooks for you to explore.\nMake webhooks work for you\nWebhooks are your company\u2019s information radar system, searching the digital skies for the data you need and landing it instantly into the hands (or laptops) of your air traffic control team. \nWebhooks are shortcuts that empower developers and no-coders to streamline information transmission without the need for complicated code. Instead of relying on software solutions that might not work in the context you need, trust webhooks to get the job done.\nThe team at Make does and we\u2019d love to connect you to the wonders of webhook technology. Try out Make to discover how we enable businesses of all sizes to send incoming webhook data to 1,500+ apps and build spectacular automated workflows in record time.\nFAQs: What you need to know about webhook technology\nWhat is the difference between API and webhooks?\nThe biggest difference between APIs and webhooks is the frequency and timing with which data is communicated. API calls can be scheduled at varying intervals; API calls are made and only deliver data at these intervals. Webhooks are event-based calls; it delivers data instantly and only when an information event happens. \nIs a webhook just a HTTP request?\nYes, webhooks are specific HTTP requests. A technical definition of a webhook is an HTTP-based callback function that allows data communication between two separate apps. \nAre webhooks frontend or backend?\nA webhook can be configured to communicate information from a frontend source to a backend source. For example, a webhook can communicate data from a landing page, such as a web form, and send that information to a Discord server or Slack channel. \nWhat are the disadvantages of webhooks?\nThe two largest disadvantages of webhooks involve the applications themselves. First, if an app doesn\u2019t support webhook technology, then webhook technology won\u2019t aid you. Second, webhook calls are abandoned if not responded to, so if an app you rely on has its service interrupted, your webhooks will fail.\nIs a webhook a callback?\nA webhook and a callback are not the same, though they\u2019re very similar. Both are used for communication. Callbacks are typically used within a single app or interface while webhooks are typically used to communicate between separate apps or platforms.", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/what-are-webhooks", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-14626%2F0561415cba7bccb6dec8d1ff547eca90%2Fwhat-is-a-webhook-illustration.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "No-Code Bootcamp: How to Choose the Right One", "content": "You've heard about no-code and how it\u2019s enabling non-developers to build software without having to write code. Determined to ride this wave, you are now looking for the no-code bootcamp that will help you level up your skill set.\nThere is one issue though: With so many different no-code bootcamps out there, how do you choose the right one? \nBefore we jump into the details of making this decision, let\u2019s take a brief look at what a no-code bootcamp is. \nWhat is a no-code bootcamp?\nNo-code bootcamps are educational programs designed to teach participants how to leverage no-code platforms to build software applications, automations, or workflows. \nIt all starts with your goals\nThere is no one-size-fits-all program, and choosing the right no-code bootcamp starts with defining your goals. What do you actually want to get out of such a program? \nTo help you define these more clearly, you should first answer the following questions:\nWhich topic do you want to learn about?\nWhat level of proficiency do you wish to achieve?\nWhat is the best way for you to learn?\n1. Which topic do you want to learn about?\nDid you know that there are not one but two no-code trends and that they are very distinct from each other?\nFirst up, there\u2019s no-code software development, which empowers you to build applications without traditional coding. If you want to launch an MVP or build your own app, you should focus on learning everything about this topic.\nThe second sub-trend is no-code operations. Here, the focus is on business process automation. You will learn how to leverage no-code tools to automate workflows, connect tools with each other, and build custom internal tools.\nWhile both are worth diving into, it\u2019s best if you choose to focus on one. \nLearning no-code is a long journey, and being clear on which topic matters the most to you is the best thing you can do. You can always come back to the other one later.\n2. How proficient do you want to become?\nAre you looking for an intro or do you want to go pro?\nBeing clear about the level of proficiency you\u2019d expect to have is a fundamental step to choosing the right program. \nBootcamps will usually fall into either of these two categories:\nIntroductory bootcamps are your gateway to the no-code universe. Whether it\u2019s no-code software development or no-code operations, these programs help you start from scratch and grasp the fundamentals.\nExpert bootcamps are designed for those committed to becoming skilled no-coders. These are your go-to if you're aiming to become a professional no-code developer or a bona fide automation specialist, capable of handling intricate automation projects.\nIntroductory bootcamps are great to get a first taste of the topic and build some initial momentum, but there is still a ton you won\u2019t know by the end of these programs. \nOn the other hand, proficiency bootcamps are more comprehensive but this comes at a price: they\u2019re more expensive, take more time, and are more difficult to complete.\nHere again, there is no right or wrong option - be clear about what you are looking for.\n3. What is the best way for you to learn?\nSelecting the right bootcamp is also about finding a learning approach that jives with your professional obligations and personal preferences.\nSome examples:\nIf accountability is what makes you stick to your commitments, look for a bootcamp with a strong, supportive community, ideally with peer groups.\nIf you need the energy and interactivity of live sessions to learn, opt for a cohort-based program.\nOn the other end, if you are too busy with work to commit to a schedule, go for an asynchronous program.\nHow much time each week can you realistically dedicate to the program?\nIn a nutshell, align your preferred learning style with the bootcamp's methodology. Don\u2019t make commitments you will break later on.\nClosing remarks\nA few more remarks that did not fit in the framework I shared above:\nNo-code is a broad, rich topic to explore. Be wary of programs claiming they cover everything.\nIntegration platforms like Make are the Swiss knives of no-code: whichever your way is - no-code development or no-code ops - learning an integration platform like Make is a must.\nMakers are the best teachers. Learn from people who are building and practicing what they teach on a daily basis.\nLook for programs designed for you. If past students have similar backgrounds and experience, that\u2019s usually a good sign.\nEmbarking on a no-code journey is an exciting endeavor - whether you are exploring the basics or aspiring to become a proficient no-code builder - don\u2019t hesitate to go for it.

For example, we can install bots from the Discord app directory, or create webhooks to receive data from other apps.\nWe can also set up Discord integrations to connect Discord with the apps we use to manage our community.\nThese integrations aren\u2019t difficult to build and can help power up your Discord server in ways that bots and webhooks can\u2019t.\nSo, let\u2019s look at what Discord integrations are, how to build a Discord integration, and integration ideas for extending your Discord server functionality.\nWhat are Discord integrations?\nDiscord integrations are software connections that send data between the Discord chat app and other apps.\nFor instance, we can have a Discord integration that instantly translates any message we send to our Discord channel, and then posts the translation back to the same channel.\nBy setting up Discord integrations, we get new tools for monitoring and moderating Discord chats via other platforms. Sharing content from other apps to one or more Discord servers also becomes more convenient thanks to integrations.\nThe result is that we\u2019re better equipped to enrich the discussions in our servers and to manage our community in a more effective, less resource-intensive manner.\nDiscord integrations, bots, and webhooks: What\u2019s the difference?\nDiscord integrations, bots, and webhooks differ in terms of the apps they involve and the actions they can take.\nDiscord bots are computer programs designed to carry out specific actions within a Discord server - and only within the server.\nFor example, you can prompt your Discord bot to generate icebreaker questions in a Discord channel for members to answer. But it can\u2019t connect to other apps - much less send or receive data from them.\nOn the other hand, Discord webhooks are URLs that help your Discord server instantly receive data from other apps. They\u2019re useful for automatically sending data from external apps (such as online form submissions) to your server when that data is created.\nBut the data transmission works in only one direction, and you won\u2019t be able to use your webhook to send data from Discord to other apps.\nSo, Discord integrations offer the most flexibility here. Not only are they able to connect to external apps, but they can also send and receive data from them.\nWhich apps can Discord integrate with?\nTwitch, YouTube, and Patreon are some of the apps Discord natively integrates with. These are apps for which Discord offers its own integrations.\nIf you seek to integrate with another app - and there are thousands of other apps for which Discord doesn\u2019t feature native integrations - you can either code through the Discord API or rely on a third-party platform like Make, which can integrate Discord with 1,500+ apps. \nWe\u2019ll share more on how Make works later, but apps we can integrate with Discord using Make include:\nGoogle apps like Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive.\nProject management apps like Trello, Asana, and ClickUp.\nSocial media apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter).\nFind more apps you can integrate with Discord using Make here.\nHow to set up a Discord integration\nOption 1: Use a native integration (when available)\nIf an app natively integrates with Discord, it will offer built-in settings for connecting your Discord server to it.\nFor example, to natively integrate Twitch with Discord, you\u2019ll first need to connect your Twitch Affiliate or Partner account with your Discord user account (not your server).\nAfter that, you\u2019ll get new settings for enabling and configuring the Twitch integration with your Discord server.\nMaking use of an app\u2019s native Discord integration is the most straightforward method of integrating Discord with it. However, these integrations are usually only suitable for simple two-app or two-step integrations - namely, when something happens in one app (which is the first step), something else happens in the second app (which is the second step).\nSo, if an app doesn\u2019t have a native integration with Discord, or we want more powerful, multi-step integrations, we can tap into Make to bridge this gap.\nOption 2: Build Discord integrations with Make\nMake is a powerful integration platform for connecting apps, sending data between them, and setting up the actions that take place when they receive the data.\nFor example, we can build a Google Calendar-Discord integration that gets a list of our Google Calendar events for the day and then posts the list to our Discord server.\nMake works on a no-code basis, meaning that we\u2019ll be able to build our integrations without writing a single line of code. That\u2019s because Make\u2019s app modules already contain the code needed to make our integrations work.\nOn our end, we\u2019ll just need to drag and drop the modules into a visual editor, and then customize their settings.\n3 Discord integrations you can build with Make\nBefore building a Discord integration, you\u2019ll need to know the apps you want to integrate with Discord, as well as the goal or purpose of the integration.\nThis can be challenging if you\u2019re new to integrations, but here are three Discord integration ideas to inspire you.\nWe\u2019ll also include their templates (pre-built integrations featured by Make) in case you want to deploy them in a matter of minutes. \n1. Dropbox-Discord integration: Send new Dropbox file URLs to Discord\nThe Make template below provides a preconfigured Dropbox-Discord integration that looks out for newly uploaded Dropbox files.\nWhen it finds such a file, it creates a share link for the file. Then, it sends a message containing the file\u2019s name and URL to our Discord server.\nYou\u2019ll find this integration useful when:\nYou\u2019re uploading large files to Dropbox and want a Discord notification when the upload is done.\nYou want to automatically notify your Discord community when you (or someone else) have uploaded a file to a shared Dropbox.\n2. Trello-Discord integration: Turn Discord messages into new Trello cards\nDid you get assigned new tasks after holding discussions on Discord?\nInstead of manually launching Trello and creating cards for these tasks, let Make handle this for you.\nThis Make template creates a Trello-Discord integration that:\nWatches for messages in a specified Discord channel.\nAutomatically turns each message into a Trello card.\nPro tip: When setting up this Trello-Discord integration, create a new Discord channel for posting messages you intend to turn into Trello cards.\nYou don\u2019t want to create unnecessary Trello cards for the casual banter happening in your channels!\n3. DeepL-Discord integration\nBefore translation apps like DeepL can work their magic, we\u2019d need to copy/paste our foreign-language text into them.\nThis work isn\u2019t difficult, but it can be tedious - unless we automate it.\nUse this Make template below to set up a DeepL-Discord integration that:\nWatches for new Discord channel messages.\nTranslates these messages to a certain language.\nPost the translation back to Discord.\nYou can connect this integration to a dedicated Discord channel for receiving message translation requests (similar to the Trello-Discord integration mentioned earlier).\nAlternatively, you can integrate DeepL with your existing channels to have the app translate all foreign-language messages posted there. The choice is yours!\nHow to build a Discord integration with Make\nHave ideas for a Discord integration? Then let\u2019s get into the nuts and bolts of building it in Make.\nMethod 1: Use a template\nIf your Discord integration is available as a Make template, building it is as simple as:\nCopying the template to your Make account.\nConnecting your app accounts to the template\u2019s modules.\nCustomizing the modules\u2019 settings.\nFor example, you\u2019ll need to connect your Discord account to the template\u2019s Discord modules and customize the contents of messages sent to your Discord channel.\nIf you think this is complicated, don\u2019t worry: It only takes a couple of clicks to connect apps to Make.\nWe\u2019ve shared some Make templates above to get you started, and you\u2019ll find dozens of others in our template library.\nMethod 2: Build a Discord integration from scratch\nMake\u2019s visual editor can accommodate unlimited app modules and scenario routes, allowing you to build any Discord integration you can think of.\nStart by identifying - and adding - the app module that should kick-start your integration.\nFor example, if you want the integration to take action on newly posted Discord messages, then add the Discord > Watch Channel Messages trigger module to it.\nAfter that, add action modules, filters, and routers to send your Discord data to other apps for their processing and action.\nLet\u2019s say that you want your integration to save all new Discord channel messages to a Google Doc. In this case, add the Google Docs > Insert a Paragraph to a Document action module after the Discord > Watch Channel Messages trigger module.\nLearn more about building custom Make integrations here.\nIntegrate your favorite apps to do more with Discord\nReady to set up a Discord integration or two for your server? Then here\u2019s how we\u2019d recommend approaching the process:\nCheck if there\u2019s a native integration for the specific app functionality you want to add to Discord. If there is and it fits the goal of your integration idea, use it.\nIf a native integration doesn\u2019t exist, check if the Discord integration is available as a Make template in our template library.\nIf you find a suitable template, use it to build your Discord integration. Otherwise, build the integration from scratch in Make.\nAnd if you need a Make account but don\u2019t have one, you can sign up for free here!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/discord-integrations-guide", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2F6UFP5jRmToiiS6E6yOv1te%2F48f42f5a64ba57a01d2fa7b1f574868f%2FDiscord_Integrations_guide.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "Why Is My Discord Ping so High? | How To Lower Your Ping Rate in 2023", "content": "Few things are more frustrating than ping issues when it comes to using Discord. \nAfter all, Discord is about quick communications, and seeing these getting interrupted is exactly the opposite of what every user wishes to experience with this beloved product. \nA high Discord ping indicates lag, which can happen for many different reasons. The most common ones include:\nPlatform outages\nInternet connection issues\nBackground processing issues (too many apps running at the same time)\nHaving the \u201chardware acceleration\u201d feature turned off on Discord\nUsing the PTB or Canary versions of the app\nOutdated drivers\nToo many cache files\nNormally, high Discord ping is due to platform outages, internet connection issues, or having too many apps running in the background. \nAs you can sense, some of these problems can be fixed right away, while others will be beyond your powers. Let\u2019s take a look at each one of them, and evaluate potential fixes.\n1. Discord outages\nGrowing pains and whatnot, \u201cDiscord down\u201d situations are rare, but not entirely uncommon: according to the company\u2019s status page, major outages happen about once a month. \nDiscord outages that affect communications are often related to key APIs such as Gateways, which is how Discord guarantees real-time communications over secure WebSockets. \nNeedless to say, there is not much you can do about outages other than wait for the company to fix them.\n2. Internet connection issues\nThis can be a common reason for Discord lag. Internet connections are affected by a myriad of reasons, spanning from weather to faulty modems and overloaded networks. \nI live in a rainy location, and had to switch internet service providers because of the weather in my area. I used to rely on a DSL connection, which runs through landline phone wiring and is often affected by rain and wind. \nAfter noticing that the situation was not going to change, I switched to fiber, and that was it. No more connection issues, and stable internet around the clock. \nTip: if you want to perform a quick internet speed test, just type \u201cinternet speed test\u201d on Google, and a tester should appear right away on your screen. Of course, if you have no internet at all, you will certainly notice before having to do this.\n\nTip #2: if you are a VPN user, please note that these tend to slow down your connection. Before trying anything else, switch your VPN off, and make sure that it's not the root of the problem.\n3. Background processing problems\nUsing too many apps at the same time can explain why your Discord freezes -- it\u2019s not the server, it\u2019s you. \nThis can also happen if you keep multiple tabs open on your browser, but you don\u2019t have to worry. It happens to the best of us, and it\u2019s easily solvable. \n\n\nFirst, get rid of the tabs you are not using on your browser. If the problem persists, close the apps that you are not using or need at the moment (check the taskbar to do this). Now, if nothing of this works, you will have to use the Task Manager (on Windows). \n\n\nThe task manager will let you see which processes are consuming CPU and memory, and decide what to do about them.\n4. Limited hardware resources\nLaptops and mobile devices grow old, and hardware restraints become real. If getting a new device is out of the question, Discord's Hardware Acceleration Feature is the path to follow. \nThis feature allows you to dedicate more resources to your Discord app. Many users have reported that activities like screen-sharing and game streaming trigger lag. To enable the feature on the app, you will need to:\nClick on the settings icon \u2699\ufe0f\nClick \u201cAppearance\u201d on the left menu\nUnder \u201cAdvanced options\u201d, toggle hardware acceleration on\nAfter you do this, a message telling you to relaunch your Discord app will appear. Click \u201cOkay\u201d, and relaunch the app to finish the process. \nIf you want to keep your FPS high and your ping down, you might want to try this one out.\n5. Discord app version\nThere are three versions of the Discord app:\nStable\nPublic Test Build (PTB)\nCanary\nDiscord PTB and Canary are beta and alpha versions, respectively. Users that have any of these versions of the app basically help Discord test new features. Needless to say, they are also prone to encountering more errors than those who use the Stable release. \nChecking your Discord version is easy and necessary. Why? Simple: because the PTB release has the same icon of the Stable one, and sometimes users are running PTB without even noticing.  To err is human, to get the Stable release is divine.\n6. Outdated drivers and other device issues\nThere is always the chance that the devices you normally use for Discord -- namely, headphones and microphone -- are either broken, not properly connected, or lacking updated drivers. \nYou will likely notice a broken device or a loose audio jack right away, but drivers are more sketchy. \nSometimes, computers don\u2019t recognize devices, even if the drivers are updated. Furthermore, it can be hard to find the exact driver your device needs (particularly when you are dealing with less-popular brands). \nIn any case, it\u2019s worth checking them up. In Windows 10, all you need to do is use the search engine on the taskbar and type \u201cdevice manager\u201d. Once there, you will be able to check your devices and see if driver updates are required. \nTo conclude, please bear in mind that whenever Discord is relaunched, audio settings get reset. In other words, if you depend on very specific settings to use Discord, this might be the root of the problem.\n7. Cache files all over\nSaving cache files on your device is a common way for apps to grant quick-loading content. However, Discord servers that deal with lots of files (usually, images) might take a toll on your device. \nWhy? Because files occupy storage space, and storage space is limited. This problem tends to surface first on mobile devices but may also affect desktop computers as well. \nIn any case, here you will find useful guides to clear your device\u2019s cache on:\nAndroid\niPhone and iPad\nWindows 10\nMac\nOnce you free up your device from cache files, it should start running a bit more smoothly than before. This can help you get rid of Discord lag; it\u2019s a long shot, but worth trying when nothing else works.\nMitigating the frustration: an integration to automatically monitor Discord status\nPicture this: you\u2019ve fixed yourself a treat and are ready to start a Discord session with your friends, only to find out that the service is down. \nThis is beyond annoying, but I came up with a method to cancel out the unpleasant surprise: a Discord status monitoring system, made with Make. \n\n\nThe integration is pretty simple. All you need is:\nA Gmail account\nAn Make account\nIn case you don\u2019t have a Gmail account, you can use a regular email account, or a Slack account as well. In every case, this integration will send you an alert when the service is down.\nHow does it work?\nThe monitoring system checks the Discord Status page on a selected frequency (up to a 1-minute interval), and sends you an email when the service is down. \nThis little system relies on the following Make modules:\nHTTP\nGmail\nThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to set anything up since the integration is available as a template. \nThe HTTP module is pre-filled, and the filter is already set up. \nAll you will need to do is:\nConnect your Gmail account (you can do this directly in the Gmail module)\nDefine the frequency of the monitoring (see the image below)\n\n\nAnd voila! Automated alerts for when Discord is down.\nConclusion: What is a good ping for Discord?\nAny ping lower than 100 ms is certainly good enough. Between 20 ms and 50 ms can be described as \"great ping\", and below 20 ms it falls under the \"miraculous\" category. \nOn the other hand, having a high Discord ping is frustrating, but there are workarounds that can help you fix Discord latency issues. \nIn the end, identifying the source of the problem and dealing with it is the best course of action. And in the cases where the problem is definitely not on your side, implementing solutions that mitigate the anxiety and frustration can be equally important. \nTo conclude, if you are interested in more Discord automation topics, here's our introductory guide to Discord webhooks. \nThat\u2019s all for today, folks. \nHappy automating!\nThis article has been updated with new information regarding ping values on August 11, 2020.", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/why-is-my-discord-ping-so-high", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-949%2F60494de67c26c86b38b7f7bf56f3107c%2FWhy_is_my_Discord_ping_so_high.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "Facebook Conversions API: The Quickest Guide to Understand It", "content": "Whether you're a brick-and-mortar business, a purely online one, or a hybrid one, Facebook\u2019s Conversions API helps you optimize your campaigns by letting Meta know which audiences are best to engage with your campaigns.\nIn other words, Conversions API is an incredibly powerful tool for understanding your website conversions and optimizing your campaigns to increase them. \nIn times when cookies are getting left behind, Conversions API stands out as one of the fastest, most complete pathways toward understanding why - and how - web visitors turn into customers.\nAudiences, conversions, and the missing piece\nNowadays, businesses use multiple channels to convert leads into customers: Online through websites, campaigns, and social media, but also offline through physical stores and events.\nIn most cases, this leads to a specific problem: the lack of cohesive, updated data regarding conversions, which translates into misaligned campaigns and wasted resources.   \nLet\u2019s illustrate this with a simple example. \nThere\u2019s a car maker that sells its models online, and also physically (or \u201cin person\u201d) through a network of dealerships. \nDealers upload their sales and conversion data into their own internal systems but fail to share some of the details with the car maker (or do it too late), who in turn keeps targeting people who already converted into customers with the wrong messages across the web and social media.\nThe missing piece is the Conversions API.\nBy leveraging the Conversions API, the car maker would get the necessary data to target people who converted offline with appropriate messaging, leading to more cost-effective marketing. \nHow to get started with the Conversions API\nAccording to Meta, \u201cthe Conversions API is designed to create a direct connection between your marketing data and the systems that help optimize ad targeting, decrease cost per result, and measure outcomes across Meta technologies.\nExamples of marketing data include website events, app events, and offline conversions. This marketing data helps enable ad personalization, optimization, and measurement across Meta technologies so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to find them relevant.\u201d\nWe\u2019re aware that some of you will read this and think about the technical and financial challenges of deploying this solution, but worry not.\nWith Make, you don\u2019t need developers to set up your integration to Meta's Conversions API because we make it easy.\nWith Make, it\u2019s the marketers who can do this on the spot. \nMake's integration with Meta allows you to inform Meta of the conversion events happening on your site by automatically pushing events to the Conversions API. \nMake shares contact information (such as email or phone), event data (e.g. purchase and event value: $100), and order ID all in a privacy-compliant and secure way.\nFurthermore, if you're in the lead generation business, the Conversions API has a solution for you too: Conversion Leads. \nWith Conversion Leads, you can track leads at various stages of maturity in your CRM and pass that information back to Meta. \nMeta Ads algorithms will find new leads that resemble your best-performing and furthest-progressing existing leads. \nIt's time to start optimizing your campaigns for quantity and quality. \nTry Make today with our special promo offer and sign up absolutely free.

Some are native (i.e. officially developed and offered by Discord), and others are 3rd-party. Let\u2019s take a look at them.\nOption 1: Use Discord\u2019s Scheduled Events feature\nThis feature lets you add events to your Discord server as shown below:\nPeople interested in the event can tap the \u201cInterested\u201d button to be notified when it starts.\nThis simple feature can accommodate only one-off events, and setting up recurring events isn\u2019t possible at this time.\nAt best, Discord will display your events in a list (as shown in the image above), but there\u2019s no true calendar view where you can see events in day, week, or month format.\nTo achieve that, you\u2019d need to add your scheduled Discord events to an external calendar app.\nDiscord also offers a built-in option for duplicating your events to a Google, Yahoo, or Outlook Calendar, but you\u2019ll need to manually do this for every new event you schedule. \nThis isn\u2019t the most ideal solution if you regularly hold events (especially recurring ones).\nOption 2: Integrate Google Calendar with Discord\nGiven the limitations of scheduling events natively, it makes more sense to create our events in Google Calendar, and then send notifications to Discord instead.\nThis way, we can access Google Calendar\u2019s powerful features for viewing events in our preferred day/week/month format, setting up recurring events, creating video meeting links, and more.\nThere\u2019s no native Google Calendar-Discord integration for automatically notifying Discord members of new Google Calendar events, but we can easily build our own such integration using Make.\nWhat can you do when you integrate Google Calendar with Discord with Make?\nMake is a no-code platform for building integrations between 1,500+ apps, including Google Calendar and Discord.\nWhen you integrate the two apps using Make, you can look forward to effortlessly doing calendar-related tasks such as:\n1. Posting a message for each of the next day\u2019s events to your Discord server\nGive members a heads-up of the events happening the next day so they remember to turn up. The template below helps create a Google Calendar-Discord integration that:\nMonitors newly created Google Calendar events.\nSends a Discord message for each event taking place the next day.\nYou can even modify the integration to change the duration of advance notice you give members about upcoming events (for example, a week, a day, or 10 minutes before the event).\n2. Updating your Discord members when an event has ended\nAfter reminding members about your events\u2019 start dates, you can also notify them about the ending of events. \nThis is helpful in terms of keeping things organized, and also to avoid people joining (very) late to events that have already been held.\nUsing Make, you can rely on an integration that watches for your Google Calendar events\u2019 end dates, and then sends a Discord message to inform members when an event has ended.\nThis template will help you get this integration set up in no time:\n3. Informing Discord members of canceled events\nIf you have to cancel an event, let your members know as soon as possible so they are aware and do not show up. Especially if you were holding an offline event that members need to spend time and money traveling to!\nThis Make template is similar to the others shared above, but it watches for Google Calendar events with the \u201cCanceled\u201d status:\nIf it finds such an event, it sends a Discord message containing the event\u2019s details to your members.\nHow to build a Google Calendar-Discord integration with Make\nIf you don\u2019t have a Make account, sign up for one here first.\nYou can then build your Google Calendar-Discord integration using these methods:\nMethod 1: Use a Make template\nLog into your Make account, and select the template you need. As a pre-built solution, setting it up will only take a couple of minutes. \nThis means customizing the settings, such as selecting the calendar that contains the events you want to watch and writing the text that your Discord messages should contain.\nMethod 2: Build your integration from scratch\nIf there isn\u2019t a template for the integration you have in mind, you can build the integration yourself. This involves identifying:\nThe function or goal of the integration.\nThe apps you\u2019ll need to use in the process.\nThe actions these apps need to take to achieve your objective.\nYou can find the available modules for Google Calendar here, and the available Discord modules here.\nLet\u2019s say we want to build a Google Calendar-Discord integration that sends a list of the day\u2019s upcoming Google Calendar events to our Discord server, like this:\nTo do so, our integration could include these modules:\nA Google Calendar > Search Events module that searches for all events happening on the day the integration is run.\nA Tools > Text aggregator module to compile these events into a list.\nA Discord > Send a Message module to send this event list to our preferred Discord server and channel.\nHere\u2019s how this integration will look when built:\nLearn more about building your own integrations with Make here.\nAdd even more functionality to your Discord server\nWe just went through just a few ideas for adding a calendar to Discord, but there\u2019s more.\nIf you don\u2019t use Google Calendar, you can easily replace it with other calendar apps featured by Make, such as Outlook Calendar.\nMake can also help you enhance Discord with more features, such as:\nPosting new tweets to Discord.\nSending Google Chrome push notifications for new Discord messages. \nAutomatically translating new Discord messages.\nReady to upgrade your Discord server?\nSign up for a Make account here to start exploring the possibilities!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-add-a-calendar-to-discord", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2FqvHNgvthlmdGnFySvkgNG%2Fcf3eda1819d6c98f3c2d22cce6c7d7dd%2FHow_to_add_a_calendar_to_Discord.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "How the ICRF Tackles Cancer Research With Automation", "content": "Welcome back to our series of Impact Stories, where we introduce organizations that serve their communities - and the world - for the better. The common thread in this series is the power of automation, and how it can help organizations achieve their goals in a fast, efficient manner. \nWhen it comes to fighting cancer, the Israel Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) is leading the charge. This New York City-based group is empowering Israel\u2019s best and brightest scientists as they tackle this illness that claims nearly 10 million lives around the world every year. \nTheir scientists are primarily focused on five main areas: Basic science, prevention, detection, treatment, and quality of life for patients living with cancer. \nWorking with a team of 20, plus some loyal volunteers scattered across the globe, the ICRF conducts worldwide fundraising efforts and then invests the proceeds in cutting-edge scientific research in Israeli labs. \nTo date, they have provided more than $87 million to support nearly 3,000 grants to Israel-based cancer researchers. And, excitingly, many of the grant recipients have been responsible for significant cancer research breakthroughs.\nBut, as an organization that was founded in the 1970s, the ICRF found that much of their medical and scientific data and processes weren\u2019t necessarily optimized for 21st-century solutions. \nAdditionally, a staff that was spread across multiple countries made collaboration less than ideal. \nSo, they looked to Make to bring their operations up to speed and enable their team of researchers to keep doing their important work with fewer roadblocks. \nHow the ICRF uses Make\nThe ICRF primarily uses Make to handle research monitoring, donor management, and bookkeeping tasks and describes the platform as the \u201cmagic\u201d behind many of their new and improved processes. \nOne of the most important aspects of any fundraising organization is having a clear view of incoming donations and available resources. \nFor this, the ICRF developed a Make scenario to send automatic, daily notifications to stakeholders with the amount of money raised the previous day. \nParallelly, various teams are notified via a Make scenario whenever a grant payment is due, streamlining the process of collecting invoices, generating payments, and gathering all the necessary documentation around this activity. \nThe results of the ICRF\u2019s automation efforts\nSince implementing Make into their daily operations, processes that had been designed nearly five decades ago are working more smoothly, and with significantly less paperwork. \nMoreover, the organization has used its success with Make to rethink daily habits and examine how to better operate from an organization-wide perspective. \nTheir end game has always been the same - do everything in their power to fight cancer. And, with automation in their corner, they are able to take on the challenge more efficiently. \nMake enables us to save precious time and use that time for additional fundraising for cancer research. The answer to cancer is research, so essentially Make isn\u2019t just helping us save time \u2013 they are helping us to save lives\n- ICRF Executive Director, Lior Lapid. \nThe numbers speak for themselves. Since implementing Make behind the scenes, more than 500 new donations came through the websites, and donor retention is up by more than 60%, more than 3 times compared to the industry average.\nThey can also lay claim to enabling the development of several new drugs, as well as various new treatment and diagnosis protocols that are now used globally. \nThe work the ICRF\u2019s researchers are doing is so groundbreaking, in fact, that two of their researchers have won Nobel prizes for their discoveries. \nWhat\u2019s next for the ICRF?\nAfter experiencing the benefits of automation, the ICRF is firmly committed to implementing Make\u2019s capabilities across the organization. \nSaving time on manual tasks enables them to focus on more important work - and in this case, it\u2019s saving lives. \nAdditional use cases are in development, including creating a research database to showcase the thousands of research initiatives that they have already funded, which, they hope will lead to greater transparency, more fundraising, and additional resources with which to continue the fight against cancer. \nThe Israel Cancer Research Fund is a non-profit organization founded in 1975. The organization consists of scientists, researchers, and volunteers from across the United States, Canada, and Israel, and it has generated nearly $100 million to support cancer research since its inception. \nTo apply for Make\u2019s NGO program, click here.", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/cancer-research-and-automation", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2F3CzRaJ5EeYjZuGji6lDOFz%2F668b2830ef7e0630fae38bff16c6ba0b%2FHow_the_ICRF_Tackles_Cancer_Research_With_Automation.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "How to Integrate AI into an App: Methods and Alternatives", "content": "Nowadays, it seems like every tech company in the market is striving to integrate artificial intelligence into their apps. \nWhile some companies have already released AI features - examples are Notion, ClickUp, HubSpot, and Salesforce - the sheer majority is still exploring how to integrate AI into their internal and external applications.\nOverall, this gives us a clear idea of what\u2019s coming: Integrating AI into apps is no longer a side quest, but a priority that will be present in most tech product roadmaps in 2024. \nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore methods, alternatives, and examples of how to integrate AI into an app, and also define what AI integrations are.\nWhat are AI integrations?\nAI integrations refer to software connections that send data from AI applications to other apps and vice versa. \nThese integrations help apps work together and provide apps with artificial intelligence capabilities like natural language processing and computer vision to fulfill actions, tasks, and processes. \nMost AI integrations are powered by application programming interfaces (APIs), which in turn are developed by the companies offering AI apps.\nExamples of AI integrations\nThere are multiple examples of AI integrations as the number of use cases keeps growing every day.\nIn fact, we\u2019ve already released several tutorials showing how to integrate AI apps with other apps to automate key tasks and processes, such as:\nCategorizing customer support tickets.\nSummarizing sales calls.\nWriting email responses.\nOn top of these, there are plenty of other Make-powered AI integrations that are readily available as templates - and that also serve us as examples for this section.  \nFor instance, by integrating Google Natural Language (one of Google\u2019s AI apps) with Google Sheets, you can automatically analyze text on the spot:\nAnother example would be to integrate ChatGPT and Telegram. By doing so, you\u2019d be able to have a bot that automatically replies to Telegram messages in just a couple of seconds. \nMethods to integrate AI into an app\nBroadly speaking, there are two main methods to integrate artificial intelligence into an application:\nCode through one or more APIs to integrate one or more apps. \nUse a third-party platform like Make to build and deploy the integrations.\nOn top of this, companies who build their own AI features (such as Notion) might skip the use of APIs altogether when integrating these features into their platforms, and go for a traditional code-based approach instead.\nHow to integrate AI into an app: Basic steps\nAs with most challenges, integrating AI into an app starts by defining the problem the integrations will solve. \nSo, the first step is to define the use case for the AI integration. \nAs we showed above in the examples section, this can be virtually anything: From summarizing text and providing answers to categorizing information and recognizing images.\nOnce the use case for the integration has been defined, it\u2019s time to check whether the necessary data is available. \nFor example, if you want to create an integration to automatically create product descriptions, you\u2019ll need to check that there are some basic product characteristics available instead of a list of SKUs.\nThe third step is to make sure that you have all the necessary pieces to build the integrations. \nMore often than not, this includes items like subscriptions to other apps that need to be integrated, API tokens, and so on.\nAt this point, you\u2019re ready to move on to the fourth step: Choosing the integration method. \nDriven by variables like technical capabilities, financials, and time-to-deployment, you\u2019ll likely be picking between a code-first and a no-code approach, and developing it in-house or externally.\nAnd of course, this will lead you to the fifth step of the process: Building, testing, and deploying the integration.\nFinal words: It\u2019s easier than it sounds\nThanks to platforms like Make, building integrations is something that anyone - tech background or not - can do.\nIf you still feel like you\u2019re not up for the challenge, a good place to start is the Make Academy. \nIn there, you\u2019ll find free courses that will show you how to build integrations from scratch, and before you know it, you\u2019ll be doing it by yourself. \nRegister for a Make account, set aside a couple of hours of your time, and don\u2019t let the momentum pass: Before you know it, you\u2019ll be building AI integrations at the speed of your imagination!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-integrate-ai-into-an-app", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2F6FSl2ZQFMjqCr35z8GZxjL%2F173ce1f966c77809ae4681d60de8f79a%2Fhow_to_integrate_AI_into_an_app.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "6 Easy Ways to Use Customer Satisfaction Data to Grow Your Business", "content": "Most business owners know, at least to some degree, how valuable customer insights are. \nThat\u2019s the main reason why so many of them launch customer satisfaction surveys and collect the data relentlessly, after all.\nBut only a few companies truly realize how to use that customer feedback to boost growth.\nThere\u2019s data to prove it too. According to research quoted by Forbes, 87% of executives are not confident that they\u2019re leveraging their customer data. \nUnderstandably, many small businesses also find it equally difficult to turn customer feedback into actionable insights. \nIn this post, you\u2019ll learn exactly how to do just that. We\u2019ll show you how to apply customer satisfaction insights into six critical areas of your business. \nBut before we get there, let\u2019s briefly address how to collect this data. \nHow to collect customer satisfaction data\nFirst things first: You collect customer feedback by running dedicated customer satisfaction surveys.\nPay special attention to the dedicated bit. That\u2019s because there are, in fact, three different types of customer satisfaction surveys. \nEach serves a different purpose and helps collect different types of feedback:\nPost-purchase surveys: As the name suggests, these collect feedback after a completed sale or transaction.\nNet promoter score (NPS) surveys: These help determine the overall satisfaction levels among customers by measuring their likelihood of recommending you to others.  What sets NPS apart from other surveys is that you can use it to evaluate almost every aspect of your company\u2019s operations - product, sales, support. To do that, you just need to amend the primary NPS question to inquire about a specific interaction.\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT) surveys: These help you collect insights on how happy customers are after having purchased from you.\nThese three survey types will help you collect data on customer satisfaction around various aspects of your company\u2019s operations. \nAnd here\u2019s how to use those insights to boost your growth.\nHow to use customer satisfaction data to grow your business\n1. Product development\nCustomer insights can drive product development in a whole range of ways:\nAnswers to NPS follow-up questions can reveal product functionalities that customers struggle with (or do not perceive as valuable enough.) Based on this feedback, you can identify which elements of the product you need to improve. Customer insights will also reveal which features need better explanation or self-help materials.\nCustomer satisfaction data will also reveal recurring issues customers experience with your product. Again, such information will help you determine how to improve the product and the direction you should take with product development.\nFinally, you can use customer satisfaction and loyalty (measured with NPS or CSAT surveys, for example) as a means to determine their satisfaction with the product. Although the data might seem vague at first, it holds the key to deciding your next actions when taking the product to the next level.\n2. Support and customer service\nWhen considering customer surveys, many businesses think about using the data to identify where their support falls short - like having customers wait too long for a reply. \nBut did you know that those insights from customers can also help you improve the overall performance levels of the team? \nCustomer data can help you determine whether you are allocating support resources right. Perhaps you don\u2019t have enough agents at the busiest times of the day? Or maybe the opposite is true, and you allocate too many people to staff hours when you don\u2019t receive as many requests?\nSimilarly, these insights can reveal whether your agents need more training, either in product knowledge or best practices in supporting customers through new channels that you\u2019ve launched, like live chat support, for example.\nAnother valuable insight you can collect relates to the most common issues your customers experience. Such data could reveal opportunities for creating more in-depth guides for customers and equipping support teams with ready-made templates and scripts that they could supply customers with quickly.\n3. Marketing\nCustomer satisfaction data can tell you a lot about how to communicate with new and potential customers. \nFor one, customer feedback can teach you how your audience talks about what you sell. And needless to say, replicating your customers\u2019 language and phrases they use will allow you to connect with them better.\nYou could also use customer feedback as testimonials and other forms of social proof.\nFinally, customer feedback can reveal new potential keywords to optimize the site and increase your search visibility.\n4. Branding and positioning\nFinding your unique brand positioning - what sets you apart from other brands targeting the same markets - is one of the hardest things to do in business.\nAnd that\u2019s what customer satisfaction, particularly researched through NPS surveys, can help you with. \nNPS surveys help you break your customer base into three categories: promoters, passives, and detractors. \nEach group can offer a unique take on what sets you apart, and how you could strengthen that positioning further. \nFollowing up with promoters and detractors will allow you to understand how each group perceives the brand. You can then adjust your brand positioning to those findings. \nFor example, you could put more emphasis on factors mentioned by promoters in your marketing collateral. And then, focus on fixing all issues that have turned some customers into detractors to differentiate yourself on the market. \n5. Customer retention\nRetention happens almost automatically when you begin to focus on measuring and improving customer satisfaction. \nWhen you begin improving areas of the business that customers have pointed out as problematic, you\u2019ll immediately reduce the friction and the reasons for someone to become dissatisfied. \nIn turn, this will result in greater satisfaction with your products and services and willingness to continue buying from you in the future. \n6. Sales\nFinally, the obvious: Customer satisfaction boosts sales! \nTake a typical NPS survey, for example. \nWe\u2019ve already discussed how the data segments your customer base by their attitudes towards the brand. Some of those customers identify themselves as promoters (people delighted with you). Others are passives (who can\u2019t tell whether they love you or not), and detractors, who are dissatisfied with your brand. \nAnd did you know that you could run upselling promotions to promoters and increase their lifetime customer value? \nThose people have already confirmed how happy they are with you after all. So it\u2019s only logical to assume that they\u2019d also be interested in other products you offer. \nConclusion\nMost businesses understand the value of customer satisfaction. Many of them relentlessly collect customer feedback and insights. But only a few know how to put all this data into practice and use it to propel their growth. \nWell, you\u2019re one of them now. You know how to use customer satisfaction data to improve six critical areas of your business: Product development, customer support, marketing, brand positioning, customer retention, and sales. \nTo conclude, let\u2019s not forget the fact that a lot of the grunt work can be automated. Dealing with survey answers is a time-consuming task, and Make can help you bear it in no time with useful, easy to set-up integrations.  \nAll that\u2019s left now is to put this knowledge into practice.\nHappy surveying!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-use-customer-satisfaction-data", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-13099%2Fc930bd9527406f2357c8f03c7d9c120c%2Fhow-to-use-customer-satisfaction-data-illustration.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "An Introduction to Facebook Conversions API on Make", "content": "These days, most marketing decisions are driven by data. Whether you are launching an ad campaign on Facebook, exploring keywords for a blog post, or adjusting a newsletter after looking at open rates, data is the key to better results. It\u2019s not hard to see why. \nAmong other things, data allows you to understand how users interact with products, apps, and sites. This information is vital to:\nImprove and update your offerings\nDeliver relevant information\nDevelop frictionless online experiences\nAlong this line, having more control over your data to base your decisions on is fundamental. That is exactly what the Facebook Conversions API offers.\nWhat is Facebook Conversions API?\nThe Conversions API is a tool that enables the sending of web events from your servers to Facebook servers. It catches specific user actions in your site, with the purpose of providing cutting-edge data for your future Facebook ad campaigns.\nHow do you set up the Conversions API?\nThere are two paths you can follow to set up Facebook Conversions API.\nManual set up: following the instructions on Facebook for Developers you can set up the API. Bear in mind, this requires coding knowledge.\nMake: set up the API in a few steps, and benefit from the hundreds of integrations the platform offers. You don\u2019t need to use code.\nIf you lack the time or resources to manually set up the Conversions API, then the best way to access it is through Make. On top of facilitating the setup process, Make allows you to connect the Conversions API to 400+ apps and 5,000+ app modules, including:\nGoogle Sheets\nAirtable\nMySQL\nShopify\nMagento\nWooCommerce\nThis is key to facilitate data flows and lay the groundwork for optimizing campaigns and audiences on Facebook.\nHow to access Facebook Conversions API?\nAssuming that you will be using Make to set up the Conversions API, you will need the following:\nMake account\nFacebook account\nFacebook Business Manager account\nFacebook Pixel ID\nOnce you have these, you will have to connect your Facebook account to Make. It only takes a couple of clicks using Make\u2019s Facebook Conversions module.\nWhat are the benefits of using Facebook Conversions API?\nThe Conversions API gives you access to valuable data about how users interact with your website. \nBut what is the difference with other technologies that also allow for this, such as cookies? The key difference is that the Conversions API collects data through the server, not the browser. \nThis data is sent to Facebook servers for analysis, with the goal of providing you with additional insight. Why are these insights particularly important? Simple: because they can be used to improve your Facebook marketing efforts by means of:\nLookalike and custom audience creation\nConversion tracking\nAd optimization\nBehavioral retargeting\nIn other words, you can think of Facebook Conversions API as the most advanced data bridge you can build between your site and Facebook Business Manager. \nMeanwhile, Make is the tool that lets you build and use that bridge in a fast and efficient manner.\nWhy access the Conversions API using Make?\nMake allows you to set up the Conversions API without code. Using Make\u2019s visual builder, you can specify which events you want to send to Facebook, including:\nPayment information\nProducts added to a shopping carts\nRegistration form completion\nProducts added to wishlists\nContact (via telephone, SMS, chat, email)\nLocation search (when someone searches for a location of your store via website)\nCheckout initiation\nSign up form completion\nPurchases\nPageviews\nOn-site searches\nKeep in mind, there are many other events you can track. What's more, you can select which events you wish to exclude from ad optimization tasks. \nIn addition, you will be able to specify which data properties you want to send. For more information about this, please visit the dedicated Make support page for the conversions module. \nTo conclude, there are two other important aspects to take into consideration when deciding on how to deploy and use the Conversions API:\nApp integrations\nCost of implementation and maintenance\nFacebook Conversions API integrations\nAs a leading cloud-integration product, Make lets you connect hundreds of different apps and modules. Since the Conversions API is available as an Make app, you will be able to connect it to other apps and modules that are also part of Make. \nFor example, you could use Make to send conversions data to another repository to streamline tasks like independent data analysis, reporting, and site optimization.\nCost of implementation and maintenance\nManual implementations of the Conversions API will likely require a professional with coding and testing skills. Make, on the other hand, lets you implement without code. There is a learning curve, but ultimately you can attain a no-code deployment in little time. \nThis is particularly important for businesses that want to keep their costs in check; as you may already know, hiring and retaining developers can be a costly and cumbersome process.\nPractical uses: Integrating Facebook Conversions API to Google Sheets and Shopify\nIntegrating Facebook Conversions with Shopify can be extremely helpful when it comes to creating custom and lookalike audiences, and thus reach those who are more likely to purchase your products. \nIn the video below, we show you how to automatically send purchased orders from Shopify to your Facebook Business Manager through the Facebook Conversions API.Take a look:\nBut what if you already have the data necessary to improve your campaigns. In that case, it's even easier: all you need to do is connect Google Sheets (or Excel, Airtable...whatever rocks your boat!) to Facebook Conversions API.\nThe clip below shows you how to:\nWhy is it important to start using Facebook Conversions API?\nIn January 2020, Google announced that third-party cookies are going to be phased out of Chrome, allegedly within the next two years. \nThis looming limitation calls for new optimization methods, and here\u2019s where Facebook Conversions API comes into play. It will be the future of measurement and optimization, and getting ahead of the curve is crucial. \nFurthermore, there are other relevant reasons why advertisers would benefit from using this product in combination with Make, including:\nMore control over which events are tracked and sent\nIncreased data security by restricting access to end-user data\nIncreased flexibility in data sharing by pulling data directly from their server\nEnsured data is not lost by not relying on pixel data or cookies alone\nIn case you are wondering, these are the reasons why the Conversions API is superior to Facebook Pixel alone as well. \nFor more information about using server data in conjunction with pixel data, please visit Facebook\u2019s support page for deduplication of Pixel and Conversions API events.\nConclusion: Make, Facebook, and the future of ecommerce\nWe see this as an opportunity to improve how companies control, secure, and share their data, and we are determined to help them in their efforts. What\u2019s most, we understand that the transition doesn\u2019t need to be painful, complicated, or expensive. \nOn the contrary, it has to be easy, quiet, and successful. That\u2019s our goal, and we hope it\u2019s yours too.\nAdditional resources\nFacebook Conversions API\nFacebook for Developers - Conversions API\nFacebook for Business - Conversions API\nMake Support - Facebook Conversions API\nMake Apps - Facebook Conversions API\nEvent deduplication - Facebook Conversions API and Facebook Pixel\nMake\nAbout Make\nPricing, Plans, and Features\nFacebook Marketing Partners - Make Listing\nMake reviews on Capterra\nGetting Started With Make\nGetting Started\nCreating a Scenario\nApps and Integrations\nFacebook Integrations: A Guide for Beginners\nThis post has been updated on July 16, 2020, to reflect a name change in the Conversions API product, formerly known as \"Server-side API\", and on July 21 with updated information.", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/facebook-conversions-api", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-958%2Fc2c6e3bc3bd5a62b23fa9e5c8759e6e6%2Fan-introduction-to-facebook-conversions-api-on-integromat.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "25 Simple Workplace Automation Ideas for Teams Under 25 Employees", "content": "Running a small business is tough. From budget constraints to multitasking, small teams have to be resourceful and innovative to survive. \nThere are no doubts that the rewards can be high, but so are the risks. Out of all new businesses starting up (4.41 million in the US in 2020), only half survive their first year. \nClearly, small teams need all the help they can get. And this is what makes workplace automation an important factor in their success. But what is workplace automation in the first place?\nIn its simplest acceptance, workplace automation is the process of leveraging technology to complete tasks without human involvement. \nIn other words, workplace automation is using software to fulfill repetitive tasks that:\nTake too much time\nDrive up costs\nDon\u2019t really require human input to be completed\nThese tasks can range from generic (such as sending form data into a spreadsheet) to custom processes involving many apps and steps. \nBefore we go into workplace automation examples, let\u2019s take a quick look at the benefits it can bring to teams under 25. \n7 instant benefits of workplace automation\nSmaller teams are typically low on resources, but they have an advantage: flexibility. This allows them to automate the workplace faster than larger businesses. \nNow, let\u2019s take a look into the benefits workplace automation brings to SMBs.  \n1. Edge over competitors\nSaying that competition is fierce might sound clich\u00e9, but it isn\u2019t. Data shows that applications for launching a business have nearly doubled over the last decade. \nWith more businesses hitting the market, automation can provide the necessary edge to beat competitors. \nAutomated processes empower small teams to turn their ambitions into reality, regardless of:\nBudget\nHead count \nTraditional entry barriers to entry \nA great example of this can be seen in the case of finn.auto, the German car subscription company. \nBy implementing automation early on, finn.auto managed to build a successful business to compete in equal footing with industry giants like Cadillac, Porsche, and Volvo.\n2. Reduced labor costs \nFor most businesses, the biggest cost is labor. \nIt can account for as much as 70% of total business costs, once you factor in employee wages, benefits, and payroll. \nIn many sectors - such as technology - labor costs make it even harder to compete:\nImage credit: Payscale\nWith rising labor costs, small businesses have to make sure they\u2019re spending appropriately. \nBy reducing the amount of human input needed, automation can help keep those costs in check. \n3. Easy to adopt \nAccording to a McKinsey study, 31% of businesses have automated at least one process.\nIt goes without saying that some companies automate because they need to, but also because it\u2019s fairly accessible to do so. \nThanks to no-code tools like Make, automation no longer requires extensive technical skills. \nAs a result, it only takes a curious mind to build and implement automated workflows.  \n4. Happier employees\nHappy employees are good for business.\nOn the other hand, overworked and unhappy employees are not. It has been reported that burned-out workers are:\n60% more likely to take a sick day\n2 \u00bd times more likely to be seeking for a new job\nLess likely to discuss performance goals with managers due to lower confidence\nThat is not counting the financial impact of burnout, which costs the economy between $125-$190 billion a year.\nBy helping workers streamline the repetitive, automation can help reduce these issues before it\u2019s too late.\n5. Remote-friendly  \nRemote work has become the new normal for millions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWhile this has brought new challenges, it also served as an opportunity to shape the future of work.\nChris Herd, Founder & CEO of Firstbase, has listed automation as one of the main factors that will help establish remote work as the norm in the upcoming years.\nAnd it\u2019s true. Automation makes remote work easier by:\nFacilitating communications across different time zones\nTracking activity and feedback across teams\nDecreasing redundancy and eliminating task blockers\n6. Transparency\nWorkplace automation can help track most business metrics, allowing for better management. \nThis heightened awareness can result in educated strategy decisions, instead of \u201cwinging it\u201d.\n7. Increased productivity and efficiency\nAutomation has historically been linked to productivity. \nData-backed research shows that automation has a positive impact on that front.\nImage credit: ServiceNow\nAs far as Make is concerned, the proof is in the pudding. By connecting 3 apps together this German consulting firm observed a 17% efficiency increase. \nResults, not excuses.\nWorkplace automation sounds like a charm, but that\u2019s certainly not enough to get started. Figuring out what to automate can be tricky and intimidating. \nFret not. We\u2019ve put together a list of 25 workplace automation ideas to get you inspired. \nSometimes, that\u2019s all it takes to start automating!\n25 workplace automation ideas\nOur list of workplace automation ideas encompasses five categories:\nCommunication and project management\nHuman resources and operations\nCustomer support\nSales\nMarketing\nIn addition, you will find that the ideas fall within three different types of solutions, including:\nNative automation product features that are available in business software\nDedicated tools serving a specific automation purpose\nComprehensive automation platforms like Make\nEach option has their pros and cons, and we invite you to evaluate what fits your business best.\nOperations and human resources\n1. Using forms to streamline your recruiting process\nHiring is critical for smaller teams. When the headcount is low, new hires can make a significant impact in how a company operates.\nHowever, hiring is hard, and demands many tasks to be completed, such as:\nDrafting the job posting\nPosting on job boards and social networks\nGoing through applications\nShortlisting applicants \nConducting interview rounds\nSending contracts and other onboarding documents\nWhile human involvement is necessary, many of these steps can be automated. \nFor example, online forms can help you automate sorting through applications in an easy, no-frills manner. \nSolutions like Cognito Forms allow you to setup an application form to sort through the applicants based on their answers:\nImage credit: Microsoft\nThis makes a world of difference when you\u2019re going through dozens or even hundreds of applications. \n2. Improving employee onboarding\nA great onboarding experience can improve employee retention by 82%, and productivity by over 70%. \nOn the other hand, the cost of turnover per employee typically ranges from 100\u2013300% of the individual\u2019s salary.\nImage credit: Zenefits\nAutomated onboarding workflows can help you accelerate the process without losing resources. \nOnboarding tasks you can automate include:\nAhead of the first day: Sending the contract, directions to the office, other informational resources\nOn the first day: Sharing a handbook and documents about the company and role\nOn the first week: Adding the new hire to Slack channels, providing an email address, auto-scheduling meetings with the team or with an onboarding buddy\n3. Collaborative scheduling\nShifts and scheduling are better without messy spreadsheets and time-consuming back and forths. \nTo avoid confusion, teams can use dedicated scheduling tools such as findmyshift. This platform features automatic notifications for shift changes. Plus, it provides every staff member with a shared interface to keep track of the schedule. \nYou can also create your own custom system. Setting up a collaborative schedule on Airtable is relatively easy with existing templates. In addition, you can set up automated notifications with Make.\nImage credit: Airtable\n4. Automated reporting\nReports are key to visualize operations and performance. However, not many SMBs can spare the time to create them. \nThis is a typical task that can be automated with Make. Simply pull the data generated by other tools, and push it to a spreadsheet or KPI board. \nYou\u2019ll get all the metrics, without any of the data-gathering hassle.\nImage credit: Reddit\n5. Accounting automation\nWithout proper accounting, managing small business finances can quickly become a nightmare for owners. As a matter of fact, it has been reported that nearly a third of companies fail because they run out of cash. \nWhile we acknowledge that accounting is a very diverse field, some areas can benefit from automation. This is especially true for small businesses that might have one person to manage finances.\nCollaboration & Project Management\nHowever small your business or team, communication and collaboration is key. \nIn this line, project management and internal communications are areas that can be improved with automation. Let\u2019s see how.\n6. Avoiding communication silos by leveraging notifications\nSilos are a threat to teams, in disregard of size. \nWithout visibility, critical data might stay stuck in an inbox or a Slack DM, away from key stakeholders.\nTools like MailClark or Front help create a shared inbox for your team. These allow stakeholders to have more visibility on conversations.\nAnother option is to leverage bots. Slack bots, for example, can automatically run tasks and report on shared channels or via direct messages. \nThere are many Slack bots you can easily implement, as well as their equivalent on the Microsoft Teams platform.\nImage credit: Niklas Heidloff\n7. Auto-forwarding emails to relevant stakeholders\nWe spend 17 hours every week on reading, replying to and writing emails. \nIf this sounds like a lot, that\u2019s because it is. A lot of internal email communication is time-consuming and should be automated. \nA simple way to do this is by setting up auto-forwarding rules in your email client. By doing this, you can make sure that relevant stakeholders get the information they need, when they need it.  \nIf you want to try this out, you can use this scenario. \nIt helps you forward emails containing a specific word to whoever needs to know about it. \n8. Reducing manual input in project management\nA smaller team does not translate into easy project management.\nPMs at small companies tend to take on more responsibilities, making their role even more challenging.\nProject management tools are designed to help teams organize tasks and improve collaboration. It has been observed that companies with project management practices save 28 times more money than those that do not. \nThere are plenty of platforms to choose from:\nTrello: Visual, kanban style list-making app \nAsana: Collaboration tool focused on simplicity\nClickUp: Productivity platform packed with features\nBasecamp: All-in-one toolkit for working remotely\nIntegrating these tools within your software stack will allow you to automate your project management processes. Some ideas you can consider include:\nSending automated tasks reminders\nAdding tasks automatically from other tools (CRM for example) \nNotifying stakeholders of progress made \nMoving tasks between stages of completion automatically\nInitiate an associated workflow when a task is created  \n9. Promoting daily interactions using a Slackbot\nStandup meetings are widely used by teams running on deadlines. Their goal is to keep every member accountable and to make sure no one is left behind. \nIf you want to guarantee participation in standup meetings, automation is your friend (even if your team is fully remote). \nFor example, you can invite your team to answer 3 questions, automatically and on a daily basis:\nWhat did you complete yesterday?\nWhat are you working on today?\nIs anything standing in your way?\nA simple Slackbot will automatically post the questions and collect answers. \nTo do this, you can choose paid options like Geekbot or Standup Bot, or build your own. \nThis can be done directly from your Slack workspace settings or using Make as well.\nImage credit: Standup Bot\n10. Supercharging your internal knowledge base \nDocumenting is not always a priority in smaller businesses. This often results in risk, with employees potentially becoming a single point of failure. \nThis is why companies decide to implement an internal knowledge base.\nHaving a database of resources has been proven to reduce employee research time by as much as 35%. This can have an impact on several areas of operations, from productivity to the ability to answer customer queries in time.\nHowever, as internal knowledge bases grow, it can be difficult to keep it organized.\nTo solve this, you can add an automation layer. Tools like Spoke allow users to fetch information from the base by asking a bot in Slack or Microsoft Teams. \nCustomer support \nFor small teams with limited hands on deck, automation is a lifeline. \nHere are some examples of customer support automation ideas that can make a real difference.\n11. Automatic replies to inquiries \nSending an automatic email after receiving an inquiry can make a big difference for your customers. \nStudies have shown that waiting just 10 minutes to respond to a message drops the likelihood of qualifying a lead by 4.\nWhether you\u2019re receiving requests by forms, email or chat, a simple templated answer can buy your customer service reps some time:\n\u201cHello {first_name}, thank you for reaching out! We will get back to you shortly, in the meantime feel free to give us more details about your inquiry.\u201d\nCustomer support software solutions like Zendesk offer similar features. You can detect if your customer support team is idle, or send a predetermined message during off hours.\n12. Automating user feedback with forms\nCustomer service reps are the frontline workers of your business, and are a great source of information. This information is precious, but can also get lost along other tasks and priorities. \nThe solution is to automate user feedback using forms. \nHow? Simply send out forms to clients following their purchase, once their trial is over or after interacting with your team. \nYou can then use Make to route their answers directly to your customer service platform, turning them into tickets that you can address in time.\nUse this template to automatically create Zendesk tickets from new Google Forms responses.\n13. Leveraging your knowledge base to weed out support request\nCustomer-facing help centers are another way to assist customers. \n90% of customers want an immediate answer to their customer service question. Unless you\u2019re planning to expand your team, providing a self-serve solution is the way to go.\nTools like Document360, HelpCrunch or HelpSite can help you implement such a solution. Automation can then jump in to:\nAutomatically direct customers to the knowledge base via a chatbot\nCross-post content between your internal and external knowledge base\nAuto-publish new knowledge base articles in your blog, or on social media\n14. Helping customers in online communities\nInteracting with users in a community has several benefits:\nBuild an engaged user base\nPromote transparent, public customer support\nReceive organic feedback and suggestions\nMost platforms feature notifications that will alert you when a message has been posted. \nHowever, you might not want to spend your day monitoring and jumping in conversations.\nUsing Make, you can set up filters to notify when a message has been left unanswered for over an hour, for example. \nAnother idea would be to automatically send a private message to users posting threads featuring certain words (\u201cdisappointed\u201d, \u201ccancel\u201d, \u201cunsubscribe\u201d, etc). \n15. Automating ticket routing\nFirst reply time (FRT) is a reference metric for customer support effectiveness. Effective FRT varies depending on the channel, but the usual hallmarks are: \nFor emails: 1 hour or less\nOn social media: 15 minutes or less \nOn live chat: 1 minute or less\nOf course, automated responses do not count towards FRT. \nIn order to optimize ticket handling, automated ticket routing can help a lot. \nThis can be achieved by labelling requests, and then matching them with the best agent for the job. \nAutomated ticket routing can be achieved by using a ticketing platform offering the feature, or by using Make to create the workflow.\nImage credit: Zendesk\nSales\nSales is one of the most automation-friendly areas of business. To understand why, consider some of the tasks a salesperson conducts on a daily basis:\nSending email reminders\nFilling out information in the company CRM\nFinding leads through different channels\nEnriching leads by finding information online\nDrafting proposals\nYou might have noticed that none of these are directly related to selling, which of course hurts sales.\nImage credit: Intercom\nWorkplace automation can help you automate some of these tasks, so salespeople can spend more time selling. Here are some ideas:\n16. Handling meetings automatically\nMeetings are at the heart of a sales, and can quickly become a nightmare. Much like the rest of a salesperson\u2019s activities, they come with a lot more tasks than the meeting itself:\nBack and forth to decide on a time\nAdding the meeting in the calendar\nHandling cancellations and rain checks\nSending reminders before the scheduled time\nFollowing up after the meeting\nAppointment scheduling tools like Calendly are helpful here. You can share a link displaying availability, receive and send reminders, and give the option to reschedule meetings. \nAutomation comes next, as native integrations or an automation platform can come in and facilitate the extra tasks mentioned above. \n17. Qualifying leads with forms and adding them to your CRM \nAs a salesperson, having a fully-booked day of demos and meetings is usually a great feeling. However, low-quality leads can make that feeling go away real quick. \nTo make sure there\u2019s a fit, most companies usually have a system in place. A sales development representative (SDR) might have an intro call to establish whether the basic requirements are met on both sides before moving forward. \nAs a small team, you might not have that luxury.\nForms are a great way to automate that process. You can ask these questions and qualify leads beforehand, without dedicating your sales team\u2019s precious time and energy.  \n18. Enriching leads by putting research on autopilot \nSales involves a lot of copying and pasting. \nWhile this is accepted as part of the job, it\u2019s ineffective and inaccurate.\n\u201c30-50% of CRM and ERP data is inaccurate.\u201d\n- Henry Schuck, Founder, and CEO of ZoomInfo.\nOne of the benefits of workplace automation is accuracy. Even the best and most dedicated sales rep makes mistakes. Automation rarely does.  \nLead enrichment tools like Clearbit or InsideView help cut down on a lot of the research. Alternatively, Make allows for quick research by pulling key data from LinkedIn. \nUse this template to automatically pull LinkedIn contact info to a new HubSpot CRM company.\n19. Following up on leads with an email\nThe meeting is only just the beginning. Studies have shown that 80% of sales require 5 follow-up calls, but 44% of salespeople give up after one. \nMost CRM platforms - including Pipedrive, HubSpot or Salesforce - feature the option of email follow-ups. \nIf your CRM doesn\u2019t, Make can take over by connecting it to your preferred email outreach tool.\nImage credit: Pipedrive\n20. Creating sales documents automatically\nSales teams spend a lot of time dealing with documents. It has been reported that 59% of sales managers think agreement preparation takes too much time. \nWhat\u2019s worse, salespeople are also involved in crafting the materials, including:\nLegally-binding contracts\nPersonalized proposals \nLeaflets and sales collaterals\nPresentations\nThis is a typical automation use case. \nA platform like Make can help pull data from a CRM and automate document creation. For example, whenever a lead reaches a certain stage in the pipeline, a custom doc is created.\nMarketing\nDigital marketing has become a staple for modern consumers, who now expect personalized, tailored experiences. \nAs a result, global spend on marketing automation is predicted to reach $25B by 2023. \nYet, for a lot of small businesses, marketing is still not a priority. There are a few reasons for that:\nCost: Tools and hires can be expensive\nConfusing: Too many options to choose from\nHard to track: ROI can be hard to measure\nPlatforms like Pardot or HubSpot offer advanced options to cater to customers, deliver campaigns and track your marketing efforts accurately. But costs can quickly add up. \nLet\u2019s look at some affordable automation ideas you can implement today without breaking the bank. \n21. Automated social media posting\nSocial media is the preferred advertising platform for SMBs, with 64% of small businesses using it in their marketing strategy. \nBuffer and Hootsuite can be used to automate the publishing of content. \nIf you\u2019re ready to go a bit deeper, Make offers advanced capabilities. This scenario takes Airtable records (with images) and turns them into social media posts for you. This is a powerful way to automate your social media efforts across all platforms.\n22. Monitoring online mentions\nTracking social conversations where your company hasn\u2019t been tagged can help you:\nGather feedback\nIdentify potential issues\nCreate genuine moments\nFind opportunities\nTools like Mention or Determ help you monitor mentions of your brand online. If you prefer to monitor specific keywords, you can always automate brand mention tracking using Make.\nImage credit: Mention\n23. Sending automated drip campaigns and transactional emails\nEmail marketing has the highest return on investment for small businesses, with a reported $42 for ever $1 spent.\nFrom reminding customers of their abandoned cart to sending birthday messages or promotions, the possibilities are endless. \nUsing email marketing platforms like Campaign Monitor or Mailchimp will help you craft beautiful emails with smart fields, and take care of their delivery for you. \nThese platforms allow you to integrate with some of your tech stack and configure triggers. This way, customers can be enrolled in an email campaign based on their actions or their profile.\nMake can then be employed to add another layer of automation. \n24. Verifying emails to stay out of the spam folder\nThere\u2019s a basic email marketing rule many overlook: you have to make it into the inbox before anything else.\nGetting stuck in the spam folder is no fun. It will also impact your email open rates, click rates, and conversions.\nTools like Clearout or ZeroBounce help you make sure your list is good to go.

Be mindful when deciding what to automate, keeping in mind these basic principles as you start experimenting:\nStart small: A day-to-day task such as setting up a notification for yourself is a great place to start\nPick repetitive tasks: The more this task can run, the better you\u2019ll feel about automating it\nBegin with low stakes: Maybe don\u2019t start with an automated email to your 15,000 subscribers list \nWe hope that you\u2019ve been inspired to try and explore automation in your business.\nHappy automating!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/workplace-automation-ideas", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-4631%2F869be3981e02112961685d37882f1b76%2Fworkplace-automation-illustration.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "Make vs Zapier: How Are We Different?", "content": "There is no doubt that Zapier has been a pioneer in the workflow automation space.\nHowever, as the novelty fades out, the need for a powerful automation tool with extended capabilities and features becomes more evident than, say, a couple of years ago.\nThis represents one of the main reasons why Zapier users start considering Make, as our platform allows you to:\nCreate complex integrations and automate larger workflows.\nGet access to exclusive, unique features that are not available on Zapier.\nExpand automation capabilities for a fraction of what Zapier costs.\nIf you are reading this, you might be in the process of switching from Zapier to Make, or at least looking for alternatives to Zapier.\nIn this article, we will address some of the most pressing questions you have, including:\nWhat are the differences between Make and Zapier?\nHow to transition from Zapier to Make?\nWe understand the factors that come into play during these moments, and this is why we'll provide you with a clear view of why Make is the best Zapier alternative out there.\nWhat are the differences between Make and Zapier?\nThe first difference you will notice is how both platforms look and feel.\nMake features a visual automation builder - the scenario editor - that is easier to use when compared to Zapier's linear, table-like builder.\nOur drag-and-drop scenario editor allows you to visually create, edit, and expand your automations in a logical, game-like manner.\nAside from being more user-friendly, the scenario editor also shows processes executing in real-time:\nThis looks pretty slick but also happens to be a quite powerful aspect of Make.\nScenarios can grow in size and complexity, and being able to visualize every module at a glance provides:\nClarity: Getting a clear view of scenarios is key to understanding processes and improving them over time (when necessary). This is a strong visual aid for grasping data flows and results.\nError handling: Seeing and locating errors where they happen is not only important but also vital to addressing issues on a granular level.\nFlexibility: Our scenario editor makes it easy to rearrange, duplicate, share, copy and maintain workflows. There's a lot less guesswork involved when everything is clearly displayed in front of you.\nOn top of the interface, there are several differences between Make and Zapier. Let's go over them one by one.\nApps and API endpoints\nIt is well-known that Zapier features thousands of apps (5,000+), but it's not the only platform to do so, as Make features 1,600+ apps itself (and counting).\nHowever, the number of apps doesn't tell the whole story in regard to possibilities. This is where API endpoints come into play.\nMake currently features 2x more API endpoints per app than Zapier. Simply put, Make allows you to automate more actions within your apps.\nOn top of this, you can connect to any app that has an API by using Make's HTTP module.\nThis means that even if an app is not officially available on Make but there's an available API for that app, you can connect that API to other apps with the HTTP module.\nFeatures, tools, and capabilities\nThis is where Make takes the cake, as it provides a series of features that are unique and native to the platform.\nThese are:\nMulti-step workflows and instant webhook execution in all pricing plans. There's no waiting for an \"update time\" for simple 1-1 integrations.\nMultiple workspaces, custom user roles, and teams. One company = one Make account where you determine who gets access to what.\nUnlimited use of all tools including filters, functions, and routers (paths) on all plans.\nRe-arrange your workflows however you want - change the order of the apps at will.\nScenario inputs to trigger automations.\nOn-demand scheduling to trigger scenarios via authorized API calls.\nThe option to disable logging of transmitted data (useful for when you work with sensitive data!).\nAdvanced error handling. Make allows you to be proactive and define the actions that will be taken when your scenarios fail. A very important part of running mission-critical processes!\nAggregators to merge data as you need.\nUsers can choose where to start processing the data in their scenarios.\nEncode and decode URLs within text and binary functions.\nArray manipulation, JSON/XML parsing and serialization, cycles, and transactions.\nWhile Zapier is a functional tool for simple integrations, Make offers a range of features that is unparalleled.\nUsing Make represents a serious upgrade in light of the challenges users and businesses face on a recurring basis. \nFeatures that are present in Zapier, but improved by Make\nUniqueness aside, there are also a handful of features that Zapier has, and that Make has mastered. These are:\nAn unlimited number of routes in a scenario. Zapier allows for a maximum of five \"paths\" in each zap, while Make doesn't put a cap on how many routes you want to use.\nWorking with files, including manipulation and archiving. Zapier does provide some file manipulation capabilities, but not as advanced as Make.\nTerminology\nYou will also notice that the terminology between Make and Zapier is different. From \u201czaps\u201d to \u201cscenarios\u201d, Make\u2019s basic terms differ from Zapier\u2019s. \nYou can refer to the following list to avoid getting lost in translation: \nPlans and pricing\nIn Make, you get charged per operation, while in Zapier you get charged per zap.\nWhat's the difference?\nBy charging users per operation, Make provides a full-service platform at a more affordable price point than Zapier (depending on your usage). See more on our pricing page.\nAlso, it's important to mention that you have to keep upgrading your Zapier plan to get access to more features.\nIn turn, all the features you need to create complex and scalable scenarios are available in all Make plans.\nIf more bang for your buck is the factor that tilts the scales for you, Make is the best alternative to Zapier you will find.\nThe smooth transition from Zapier to Make\nBased on Zapier's recent pricing changes and Make's continued growth as a platform, switching from Zapier to Make is the logical step for many users.\nMoreover, building scenarios in Make is a fun activity, and spending time doing so is a great way to get accustomed to how the platform works.\nAs you do so, we invite you to explore our plans and sign up for a free Make account to get a first-hand impression of what our platform can do for you and your business.\nIf still in doubt, feel free to visit the Make Community and find out why thousands of people love Make.\nWe'd be happy to have you on our side, and provide you with the best automation platform there is!\nThis post was originally published in October 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness in December, 2022.", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/make-vs-zapier", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2F6alhEw33GS3aOHLMb5v3oJ%2F3d3829e1e4d54e4d383b5dcd587640e6%2Fmake-vs-zapier.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "How to Start an Automation Agency According to Experts", "content": "If you work a full-time job in automation or you\u2019re a freelancer in the space, chances are that you\u2019ve developed the itch to start your own automation agency.\nMaybe you feel the call to step away from your 9-5. Or maybe you\u2019ve freelanced for a while and have created a big enough clientele to start your own business. Whatever you do for a living right now, you can envision yourself doing something grander, something greater.\nBut that begs the question \u2013 where do you even start? \nWe asked three automation experts who work at the automation agencies Erevu TechWorks, Elogia, and Altois for their advice when it comes to launching an automation agency. Read on to learn their step-by-step process for launching your own agency and providing automation solutions to your clients.\n9 steps to starting an automation agency\n1. Choose a target market that you can truly serve\nA target market is a group of potential clients that share the same business model (for example, SaaS), compete in the same industry (healthcare), and have roughly the same amount of employees as each other (enterprise).\nAs a full-time employee or freelancer, you\u2019ve likely worked with a certain target market more than you have with others.\nIdeally, you\u2019ve also enjoyed collaborating with them, are genuinely interested in their industry and understand their common pain points, processes, and players, and have experienced a lot of success with them.\nIf so, then you have a target market that you can truly serve.\nOn the outset, it might seem tempting to home in on a target market with the most potential for profit or the one with the least amount of competition. But in the long run, it\u2019s much better for business and your sense of fulfillment to focus on the target market that you\u2019ve had success with in the past and truly want to help.\n2. Specialize in one area and branch out as you grow\nWhen you launch your automation agency, it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t have enough resources to hire high-quality experts in multiple areas of automation.\nSo whether you\u2019re well-versed in marketing automation, sales automation, or HR automation, start off with your main area of expertise.\nOnce you grow and acquire enough resources to hire another expert in a different area of automation, feel free to expand your offerings.\n3. Craft a positioning statement for your brand\nAs a new agency eager to stick out from the crowd, one of your main goals is to attract as much attention from your target market as possible. But how exactly do you do that?\nYou craft a positioning statement.\nA positioning statement pinpoints the target market that your services cater to and conveys your value proposition.\nThe target market portion of the statement will instantly relate to your ideal clients and the value proposition portion of the statement will pique their interest, which is a one-way ticket to grabbing their attention.\nHere\u2019s a quick three-step process for crafting a positioning statement:\nLead off your positioning statement with the company size and industry that you want to target. \u201cWe help small eCommerce companies\u2026\nThen, highlight the service that you offer and its benefits. \u201c...grow through marketing automation\u201d\nAll together now \u2014 \u201cWe help small eCommerce companies grow through marketing automation.\u201d\n4. Pick the automation platform that you prefer and stick with it\nOdds are, most of your clients will not be familiar with automation platforms. In fact, most don\u2019t even know that they can even automate their work.\n\u201cI would say that before starting an automation agency it is a good idea to understand that most companies you will be advising do not have a dedicated software development/IT team and may not be even aware that platforms can be automated,\u201d says Phillip Ragen, CTO of Erevu TechWorks.\nWith this in mind, the majority of your clients won\u2019t have a preference for the automation platform that you use. So stick with the one that you prefer and have mastered.\nYou\u2019ll be able to do your best work for your first set of clients, which will make a good first impression on them and boost the odds that they\u2019ll refer your next set of clients.\n5. Focus on profitability and cost control when building your business model\nIf you\u2019re bootstrapping your agency and don\u2019t have any funding, then building a business model that can feasibly turn a profit should be one of your top priorities.\nWhy? Because it\u2019ll be your biggest challenge.\n\u201cThe biggest obstacle for any agency that starts from scratch is profitability and cost control,\u201d says Mayur Jawdekar, Founder of Altois.\nFortunately, there are plenty of strategies that you can leverage to do build a profitable business model:\nPrice your service at the profit margin that will keep you profitable\nStart off with a small team and only hire when absolutely necessary\nDon\u2019t bite off more than you can chew when it comes to new business\nOffer retainer agreements to clients\nJoin affiliate programs \nTake advantage of small business tax breaks and grants for entrepreneurs\n6. Keep tabs on the apps that your target market uses the most\nWhen you start an agency, one of the things that you\u2019ll quickly realize is that the platforms that you thought you knew can be overwhelmingly more complex or limited at the API level.\nThis rang especially true for Ragen and his team at Ervu TechWorks when they first launched their agency.\n\u201cNot knowing the full feature scope of both the platforms used by our clients, as well as automation platforms like Make limited the quality of the solutions we were able to offer to our clients,\u201d says Ragen.\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to stay up to date on the full feature set of all the apps that your target market uses.\nHowever, if you can maintain a broad understanding of the frequently used apps in your target market\u2019s industry and keep tabs on their overarching changes, you can still offer a ton of value to your clients. \n7. Create as much marketing collateral as you can\nYou might not have a lot of time to focus on marketing when you first start your agency, but it\u2019s crucial to nail the basics.\nFirst, create a website so people know you exist.\nThen, make social media pages so people can find you.\nFinally, write case studies on your website so people know you\u2019re worth your salt. If you were a freelancer before starting your agency, you can collect these testimonials by asking your clients for them.\n8. Gain access to the data that you need from your clients\nHaving access to your clients\u2019 data gives you a full picture understanding of their processes and lets you grasp what you truly need to automate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that the client understands how important it is to let us know what kind of data they have and the definition of its contents,\u201d says Laura Martin, Marketing Automation Expert at Elogia.\nHowever, as important as it is to get the data that you need, it\u2019s just as crucial that your clients feel safe giving you access to it.\nFrom the very beginning of your relationship, make sure to sign a contract or a non-disclosure agreement with them so they know their data is in good hands.\n9. Automate your agency as much as possible\nAutomating your agency shows your clients that you can walk the walk, which will matter a lot to them when they\u2019re deciding to work with you or not. Because if you\u2019re not relying on automation to streamline your business, why should they trust you to do the same for theirs?\nRemember, no one wants to do business with the cobbler whose children have no shoes. So automate your agency as much as possible. It\u2019ll also give you an opportunity to tout your automation capabilities through your marketing materials or during the sales cycle.\nLaunching your automation agency today\nStarting your own automation agency is most likely a dream come true for you. But before you launch, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s not going to be all peaches and cream.\n\u201cBefore starting an agency, it is always good to accept the fact that there will be highs and lows,\u201d says Mayur Jawdekar, Founder of Altois. \u201cThe entire world has been going through this huge challenge the past couple of years but taking on this mindset has been essential to our success.\u201d\nNo one said starting an automation agency would be easy. But armed with these nine steps, you can not only make it feasible but also the most fulfilling venture you\u2019ve ever embarked upon in your career.\nOnwards and upwards!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-start-an-automation-agency", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-15331%2F2cc505deaf17e71f29c102fdf8635e65%2Fhow-to-start-an-automation-agency-illustration.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "What to Automate? 3 Simple Ways to Get Automation Ideas", "content": "What should I automate?\nThis is by far one of the most common questions I get from people starting out in automation. \nAnd I really mean it. In a survey I sent out, around 80% of the responses were a variation of this.\nIt\u2019s a hot automation topic, worthy of attention. Keeping this in mind, I\u2019m here to provide you with a thorough answer to the question of what to automate. \nWhether you are just starting out in automation or looking for some ideas to automate your business, this will help you get a clearer picture of where to begin.\nBelow, my tips to identify key automation opportunities.\n1. Start small\nWith so many possibilities at hand, workflow automation serves as a good example of Alvin Toffler\u2019s concept of overchoice.  \nSo, where to start?\nThe simplest way is to pick a small task, and spend some time breaking down the process. Just by doing this it will be much easier to see if the task can be automated, and how. \nNow, what\u2019s a typical business process that is both ubiquitous and easy to automate? \nAs you can imagine, there are many, but let\u2019s just pick this one: adding leads to HubSpot CRM after they fill out a Gravity Forms contact form.  \nThe (usually manual) way of completing this process involves the following steps:\nA lead fill out a form\nThe form answers get stored on the dedicated Gravity Forms folder for answers\nYou manually copy form answers into HubSpot \nOnce you get a hold of the steps, you will find that it\u2019s easy to check if they can be automated or not. \nFor example, Make users can search for Gravity Forms and HubSpot app modules to automate the related tasks.\nNeedless to say, the modules are available, and the task can be fully automated:\nYou don\u2019t need to go after the most complex tasks from the get-go. \nNo matter how simple, a high-volume task will likely translate into more benefits than a complex one happening once in a blue moon.\nNext time you want to automate something, identify the steps first. You\u2019ll save time and have more of an understanding of whether automation is possible and helpful. \nPlus, each time you do this, you\u2019ll learn a little bit more. Eventually, seeing the steps and the automation possibilities will come out naturally. \n2. Develop a system for identifying automation ideas\nHaving a simple system or method to identify automation ideas is paramount. It will help you build your automation muscle, and set you up for cool findings.\nBelow, here\u2019s my method for it:\nBe aware and take notes\nAs you go through your normal work, think about each task that you do. \nAsk yourself if it\u2019s something you do over and over, or a task you just don\u2019t like doing. \nIf it is, write it down on your \u201cautomation wish list.\u201d\nThis sounds over-simplified, but it really is that easy. Just from reading this post and being aware of what\u2019s possible, you\u2019ll find loads of things that you could automate. Your list will probably grow pretty quickly. \nYou can even start a spreadsheet to record how often you perform a task in a day, week or month. In the case you use a time tracking tool, it will be much easier to see the tasks you are spending your time on. \nThis can help you prioritize which tasks you should consider automating first.\nThe same goes with your team. Ask them to note down anything they find themselves repeating. \nMap out your process\nWhen I do automation consults with clients, I\u2019m always amazed when someone comes prepared with a flowchart of what happens in their business. \nSometimes it\u2019s just a sales process. \nOther times it\u2019s their entire delivery. \nWhatever it is, it\u2019s a brilliant way to start identifying bottlenecks or processes that can be automated. \n3. Look into task categories and examples\nLooking at task categories and examples can be a great indicator of what to automate. There are a few main categories for typical tasks that can be automated. Let\u2019s check them out.\nRepetitive tasks\nAlmost every business has repetitive tasks. Many business owners just try to hire more people to do those tasks. There are a few problems with that:\nIt can be costly, especially compared to automation\nHuman error is unavoidable, so mistakes will be made\nFew people get job satisfaction from this kind of work\nThese issues make repetitive tasks a good place to start to identify things you can automate.\nExamples of repetitive tasks:\nAdding contacts to multiple systems. I still see so many businesses that get leads from their business in an email form. They then copy that information into their CRM manually. Use Make to push leads automatically into your CRM, invoicing and other tools\nSetting up new clients. When a new client comes on board, there usually is a set up process. That could include creating folders, sending contracts, and creating projects. Much of this can be automated \nSending the same/similar email. Do you find yourself sending similar emails to people regularly? These can be semi-automated with a tool like TextExpander, storing the bulk of the email as a shortcut on your keyboard\nChasing payments. Instead of chasing invoice payments manually, get paid upfront, or send follow up emails automatically\nDouble handling\nDouble handling is when you take the same information and put it in multiple places. It\u2019s a type of repetition that is very prone to human error. \nExamples of double handling include:\nSocial media posts. When you post the same or similar post to several social channels. This can be automated with Make to repost from one platform to another. Or you can use Buffer to create different posts at the same time and schedule them.\nUpdating contact information. When contact details change, you might have to edit that person in multiple systems. Keeping systems in-sync should be done automatically so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\nTracking events. An event can be anything from a client making a payment to someone filling out your contact form. You can use automation to mark a client as paid, or update the \u201clead source\u201d in our CRM as \u201ccontact form\u201d. \nEmail tasks\nEmail is one of the biggest productivity killers around. Automating things that clutter your inbox is a great opportunity to save a lot of time for yourself. \nExamples of things that result in excessive email:\nBooking meetings. The back and forth email of setting up meetings is a waste. Fix it with something like Calendly\nNotifications and alerts. Many services send alerts and notifications via email. You can automatically push these into a channel in your Slack and archive them in your email, so they don\u2019t occupy your inbox\nCollecting information. Going back and forth asking clients to send you information can build up long email trails. Use a tool like Content Snare to semi-automate it \nClient requests. If you deal with a lot of incoming email from clients, there are loads of tools to help manage and delegate them. Look at helpdesk systems like Helpscout or shared inbox tools like Front.\nTasks you forget to do\nMost automation is aimed at doing repetitive work for you. However it can also be used to help you stay on top of things. \nWe\u2019re all so busy that it\u2019s easy to get caught up doing other work and forgetting to focus on important tasks. \nExamples of things you might forget to do are:\nFollowing up on emails. It\u2019s easy to forget about emails you need replies for. Tools like Follow Up Then make sure you remember to follow up \nTeam check ins. Team updates help you stay on top of each person\u2019s workload and identify if they need help with something. You can set up automated reminders to get updates from your team, or remind yourself to check in with them\nProject activity. Seeing what\u2019s happening on all your projects helps you identify when issues are arising. You can send yourself daily reports to make it simple to stay on top of all project activity\nSocial media monitoring. If you want to respond to brand mentions on social media quickly, monitor for keywords with Make \nMeetings. If you are missing meetings because you\u2019re too focused on something else, set up alerts to remind you right before\nReporting tasks\nStaying on top of everything that is happening in your business is time consuming. \nThere are multiple systems, tools and reports that you need to go through to get the full picture. But it\u2019s easy if automation delivers you exactly what you want to know.\nYou first need to choose what you want to use to receive that information. Do you want a dashboard, or is a notification feed enough? \nYou could use a:\nBusiness dashboard like Google Data Studio or Databox\nProject management system, where each report is delivered as a task\nCommunication tool like Slack, where reports and notifications are delivered to a channel\nThen you just push all the data you need into that system - so you only have one place to go. \nSome useful examples of reports you can automate are: \nKPIs. Periodic reports of project activity, marketing results or any other KPIs\nNotifications. Website downtime, social media mentions\nPayments. Daily summaries or a message every time a payment comes in\nFeedback. Summaries of recent customer feedback and testimonials\nConclusion\nTo summarize, starting out with automation requires an eye for detail. \nOnce you start identifying processes, areas, and examples, it will be a matter of time before you start automating.\nSometimes, all it takes is looking at what we do with new eyes and an open mind. \nChange isn\u2019t always easy, particularly when you grew used to doing things one way. \nHowever, the benefits automation can bring to how you work and earn are too good to overlook. \nNow, it\u2019s time for me to say go. Or, as they like to say here at Make, \nHappy automating!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/what-to-automate", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-4611%2Fa38096dd0e282664d60b219450b848fc%2Fwhat-to-automate-illustration.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "Automators Toolbox: 26 Custom Modules to Boost Your Integrations", "content": "One of the most overlooked aspects of Make is the possibility of uploading and releasing apps on the platform.\nThis is done through Make\u2019s Developer Platform, which allows you to create Make apps and modules for private or public use.\nBut why would anyone want to do that?\nA compelling reason to upload an app to Make is a mix of privacy and convenience.\nFor example, it\u2019s not uncommon for some companies to have private APIs, which are only used in-house. As you can imagine, integrating these private APIs organically is a cumbersome process that drains company resources.\nNow, by uploading these private APIs to Make, companies can integrate them with hundreds of apps on the spot while keeping them private and accessible to those inside the organization. Pretty cool, huh?\nThe second reason is perhaps the most significant one: By having your app featured on Make, you will be allowing users to make the most of it by means of app integrations and workflow automation.\nSimply put, you will be able to meet your users\u2019 demand for app integrations in a striking fashion - that is, by standing on the shoulders of Make.\nBut there\u2019s a third, and less explored reason why some companies release apps on Make: Because it\u2019s a prime platform for all-things automation.\nIn this article, we will show you an example of a custom app that was released directly on Integormat to address the demands of a growing community of users and clients.\nThis is the story of Eyal Gershon and the Automators Toolbox, aka \u201cEyal\u2019s Toolbox\u201d.\nOne hat too many: The origins of the Automators Toolbox app\nEyal Gershon is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Callbox, a company that provides custom lead tracking and marketing technology solutions for 500+ customers around the world.\nIn addition, Gershon is a certified Make partner, and one of the administrators of Israel\u2019s largest automation community, featuring 7,000+ members. It is here where the idea for a series of custom Make modules started to take form.\n\u201cI kept getting asked the same questions over and over again, to the point where I started to think - why not make an app with several simple modules that basically answer those questions?\u201d\nAs time passed by, Gherson kept developing more custom Make modules. Soon after, he found himself with 20+ different solutions on his hands, which he bundled up and released on Make. The Automators Toolbox was born.\nIn Gershon\u2019s words, the app was released directly on Make because the platform \u201cis a great solution for when I want to hit the ground running and most people need quality\u201d.\nAnd now, these solutions are available to anyone with a Make account. Let\u2019s take a look at some of them.\nA magic box of digital gadgets\nThe Automators Toolbox app features 26 modules oriented to solving specific automation and development problems.\nFor the sake of brevity, we\u2019ll go over the most prominent ones, and invite you to check the full list on your own. Let\u2019s take a look.\n1. Convert hexadecimal to decimal\nThis is nothing but a little automated hex-to-binary calculator that you can use in your Make scenarios.\nConverting hexadecimal to decimal is a popular problem among developers, and this module solves it in a simple fashion by converting the data to a readable string.\n2. Convert XML to a JSON object\nThis module turns XML text inputs into a nicely formatted JSON object (or collection of objects).\nEven though Make features a built-in XML parser, it\u2019s not rare to find CRM fields containing XML text, which tends to complicate things a bit - until you get your hands on this module.\n3. Create HTML code from table (advanced)\nIdeal for front-end developers who wish to speed things up, this module will generate an HTML table and provide the option to assign table headers.\nWhy spend a lot of time coding an unknown table that landed on your desk, when you can run it through this module and have it ready in a minute?\n4. Fix email address domains\nOn top of being a developer, Gershon is a martech expert - and it shows.\nThis module will fix wrongly written email address domains and format them correctly.\nIn other words, you can pass email addresses through this module, and if the domain name is misspelled, it will try to fix it.\nFor example, imagine that you run a Facebook Lead Ads campaign and that a few leads have provided the email wrongly; say, by writing \u201c@gmial.com\u201d instead of \u201c@gmail.com\u201d.\nInstead of having to check and correct, you can run all the form answers by this module, and you\u2019ll have them all fixed in less than a minute.\n5. Generate QR codes automatically\nWell, the name says it all, right?\nNow that there\u2019s a QR code for everything, spending time creating them is a great way to waste it.\nThis module will generate a QR code from a URL in binary format, effectively automating the lengthy process of creating QR codes manually, and one by one.\n6. Multiple search and replace\nNeed to send emails in bulk but don\u2019t want to miss the personal touch? If so, here is a solution for you.\nThis module replaces multiple values of a text input and generates a new string, allowing you to make multiple search and replace tasks automatically.\nIt\u2019s very useful for ecommerce businesses as well. Imagine that you have a string message like the one below:\nHi fname,\nYour product has been shipped and will be sent in the next days_amount days.\nYou shipping data is:\nfname\nshipping_data\nBy using this module, you will be able to populate the message with the right data every time, and without spending a second on the task.\nFinal thoughts: Making work easier for everyone\nAt the end of the day, Make is all about focusing on what matters the most, and automating the rest.\nGershon\u2019s Automators Toolbox app moves in that direction by providing simple solutions to dragging problems, and it makes us happy to see proven professionals trust our platform to deliver solutions at scale.\nEcommerce businesses, email marketers, and developers can benefit from the Automators Toolbox, and use the modules to create better, more comprehensive automations.\nIn addition to this, there\u2019s an important takeaway for app developers and SaaS companies: Make can be the missing integration and automation layer a product needs to meet user demand.\nDeveloping native integrations is a difficult path for most companies, requiring dedicated talent and immense resources. Make changes this by making it easier for companies to get there faster.\nIf you are curious and want to take things further - whether by using the Automators Toolbox or by exploring the Developer Platform - all you have to do is sign up for a Make account.\nHappy automating!", "link": "https://www.make.com/en/blog/automators-toolbox", "imgSource": "https://www.make.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fqqlj6g4ee76j%2Fblog-image-13031%2Feae6044ae5cc74fe2763b0bd73c1e1d9%2Ftoolbox-pro-illustration.png&w=3840&q=90", "time": "2023/12/11 13:57:11"}, {"title": "24 Most Powerful Tools You Need to Build Without Code", "content": "No code platforms \u2014 those that allow you to create apps, sites, and integrations using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) instead of programming languages \u2014 are gaining momentum. \nFrom professionals who never learned the craft to overworked programmers seeking faster, simpler solutions to everyday problems, building without code has been the dream of many for a long time. \nPlus, no code makes perfect sense. Problems related to code (and the ability to produce it) have been plaguing the tech industry for years. Some of these include:\nA broadening in the IT skills gap\nRecord levels of burn-out in the tech industry\nPiling amounts of complex, bug-ridden code in key systems and products.\nThese reasons alone would make a strong case to explain the ongoing expansion of no code. But it doesn\u2019t end there. \nWhile relieving stress levels of programmers is a nice bonus, no code goes beyond that: its ultimate purpose is to multiply and diversify the production of digital products while involving more people in the process \u2014 all at the same time. \nIn addition, it\u2019s good to clarify that no-code tools are not meant to replace programmers, just like Canva did not replace designers. \nAnd the good news is that many of these tools are already here, making a killing. Let\u2019s take a look at the no-code tools you need to start building apps, chatbots, sites, and more.\n10 No code tools and their #1 alternatives\n1. No code tools for building websites with CMS\nMost Popular Tool: WordPressPricing: From $4 to $45/month. Free version available.Launched in: 2003Userbase: 60+ million users \nWordPress has been around for a while, but still stands as the best platform to build websites. \nThe number of available templates and plugins (including page builders, contact forms and SEO tools) makes WordPress the most popular no-code tool to build websites, and it is more than likely that it will remain this way for a long time. \nOn top of its immense popularity, WordPress is fairly easy to use. \nUsers can create websites without writing a single line of HTML or CSS code. The Content Management System (CMS) WordPress provides is reliable, fast, and simple to set up. If you are thinking about building your first website using WordPress, you can start with this guide.\n#1 Alternative: WebflowPricing: From $12 to $212 / month. Free version available.Launched in: 2013Userbase: 1+ million users \nWebflow offers fewer customization possibilities than WordPress, but makes it up by focusing on one particularly important aspect: design. It\u2019s easier to achieve a professional-looking website using Webflow. \nOn top of this, Webflow does not depend on third-party plugins as much as WordPress, which makes the maintenance of sites more predictable. Webflow is ideal for personal websites, portfolios, blogs, and niche online shops. \nIn addition, it has been regarded as a prime tool for prototyping, which definitely helps explain its popularity among designers.\nHonorable Mention: Carrd \nCarrd offers the possibility to create a neat, simple, website in little time.

Chatfuel allows for advanced customization, a vital aspect advanced bots need in order to excel at their function. \nIt\u2019s a great product for companies and individuals looking for high-performance bots, but its basic plan may not be enough to tackle less-demanding needs.\nHonorable Mention: Flow XO \nFlow XO lets you create and connect chatbots to many different platforms, which can be useful to a number of companies with a sprawling online presence.

Unlike Airtable, dashdash seems to be more focused on integrations. \nAccording to CEO Humberto Ayres Pereira, dashdash allows easy consumption of data services and APIs \u2014 to the point that you can find companies on \u2014 let\u2019s say \u2014 Crunchbase, or Google Maps, and import them to your CRM. \nIt\u2019s almost like if dashdash\u2019s true power resides in the possibility of combining it with other products to create workflows and apps, and to automate tasks without coding. \nIf so, this approach would have a lot in common with a new tech paradigm that will allegedly change the way we envision, create, and commercialize digital products \u2014 you\u2019ll find more on this below.\nHonorable Mention: Actiondesk \nIf Airtable and Dashdash had a child, chances are it would look very similar to Actiondesk. This app combines Airtable\u2019s smooth interface with the Dashdash\u2019s focus on integrations and workflow automation. \nA hybrid\u2019s hybrid, Actiondesk is nonetheless a promising, growing company that should not be left out of the conversation.\n4.

An expanding API ecosystem will sustain:\nThe creation of countless no code and low code apps, in which makers \u2014 professionals from all paths of life \u2014 will be able to swiftly transform their ideas into new, exciting digital products.\nNew aggregation layers, such as no code academies and marketplaces like Zeroqode and RapidAPI.\nNo code, increasing features and capabilities, fast product to market processes: these are the basis of the API economy. \nGiven his track record as a computer scientist, investor and entrepreneur, Casado\u2019s statements are not to be taken lightly. \nPlus, he is not alone: companies like Google (who acquired API management platform Apigee for $625 million in 2016), Microsoft and IBM are also betting on a future shaped by APIs.\nConclusion: Easier doesn\u2019t mean easy, and better doesn\u2019t mean perfect\nThe association is tempting, but no code does not equal easy. In most cases, no code lowers the entrance barriers to creating new digital products, but there are learning curves to be tackled, and some can be quite demanding. \nIn the same breath, no-code tools can be used to create excellent products, but then again, don\u2019t expect absolute perfection every time (and in case you are wondering, expecting perfection from code is also a recipe for disaster). \nThe no-code industry is young and has already yielded an amazing number of platforms that are being used to create, connect, and automate. The good news is that this has just begun. \nNow it\u2019s time to go and make something out of it.
